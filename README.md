# Introduction to `OpenAnalysis`

In our daily life, we encounter many algorithms. Knowingly or Unknowingly, algorithms make our life easier. Analysis of algorithms is a special field of interest in Computer Science. Analysis evaluates the algorithm, and leads to invention of faster algorithms. Visualization leads to the better understanding of how algorithms work. The package `OpenAnalysis` is inteded as a tool for analyzing and visualizing algorithms.


## Types of supported algorithms

The following types of algorithms are currently supported. We plan to support more kind of algorithms in the future.

- Comparision based Sorting Algorithms ( Analysis + Visualization )
- Comparision based Searching Algorithms (  Analysis )
- Comparision based Pattern Matching Algorithms (  Analysis )
- Data Structures and Related algorithms ( Visualization )
- Graph Algorithms based on Tree Growth techinique ( Visualizaiton )
- Graph Algorithms utilizing Matrix and Dynamic Programming ( Visualization )

## Setting up `OpenAnalysis`

`OpenAnalysis` is only supported on Python versions which are greater than 3.5. Once you have suitable version of Python installed, you can simply obtain `OpenAnalysis` via `pip` (or `pip3`, if you have multiple versions of Python installed)

    sudo pip install OpenAnalysis

If all things go well, you have working installation of `OpenAnalysis`.
