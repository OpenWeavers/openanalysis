    "# Introduction to `OpenAnalysis`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our daily life, we encounter many algorithms. Knowingly or Unknowingly, algorithms make our life easier. Analysis of algorithms is a special field of interest in Computer Science. Analysis evaluates the algorithm, and leads to invention of faster algorithms. Visualization leads to the better understanding of how algorithms work. The package `OpenAnalysis` is inteded as a tool for analyzing and visualizing algorithms.\n",

    "## Types of supported algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The following types of algorithms are currently supported. We plan to support more kind of algorithms in the future.\n",

    "## Setting up `OpenAnalysis`\n",
    "\n",
    "`OpenAnalysis` is only supported on Python versions which are greater than 3.5. Once you have suitable version of Python installed, you can simply obtain `OpenAnalysis` via `pip` (or `pip3`, if you have multiple versions of Python installed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo pip install OpenAnalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "If all things go well, you have working installation of `OpenAnalysis`.\n",
