Some quotes from famous personalities across the world on the 

Bhagavad-Gita: 



Albert Einstein 

"When I read the Bhagavad-Gita and reflect about how God created this 
universe everything else seems so superfluous." 

Aldous Huxley 

"The Bhagavad-Gita is the most systematic statement of spiritual 
evolution of endowing value to mankind. It is one of the most clear and 
comprehensive summaries of perennial philosophy ever revealed; hence 
its enduring value is subject not only to India but to all of humanity." 

Mahatma Gandhi 

"When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and I 
see not one ray of hope on the horizon, I turn to Bhagavad-Gita and find a 
verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of 
overwhelming sorrow. Those who meditate on the Gita will derive fresh 
joy and new meanings from it every day." 

Henry David Thoreau 

"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal 
philosophy of the Bhagavad-Gita, in comparison with which our modern 
world and its literature seem puny and trivial. " 

Dr. Albert Schweitzer 

"The Bhagavad-Gita has a profound influence on the spirit of mankind by 
its devotion to God which is manifested by actions." 

Carl Jung 

"The idea that man is like unto an inverted tree seems to have been 
current in by gone ages. The link with Vedic conceptions is provided by 
Plato in his Timaeus in which it states 'behold we are not an earthly but a 
heavenly plant.' This correlation can be discerned by what Krishna 
expresses in chapter 15 of Bhagavad-Gita." 

Herman Hesse 

"The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life's 
wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion." 

Ralph Waldo Emerson 

"I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was the first of books; 
it was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, 
serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age 
and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which 
exercise us."

SRIMAD BHAGAVAD-GITA 

In English 
Introduction 

The Bhagavad-Gita is one of the most noblest and read scriptures of India, even 
one of the deepest sacred scriptures of the world, really meant for all ages, even 
more in this time and age, as it is a "psychology of the consciousness" in its 
threefold phase. The dialogue of eighteen discourses {chapters), 700 verses 
altogether, is a written contribution to the transformation of the embodied soul, 
the whole man, or as the Bible puts it in "Genesis" the "man, the living soul". 
The Bhagavad-Gita represents the soul-knowledge, the heart-love, the mind- 
knowledge, the vital-dynamism and the body action. 

According to the Psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, consciousness, seemingly the 
sine qua non of humanity is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath consciousness 
lies a much larger substratum of forgotten or repressed personal memories, 
feelings, and behaviours, which Jung termed the personal unconscious. And 
beneath that lies the deep sea of the collective unconscious, huge and ancient, 
filled with all the images and behaviours that have been repeated over and over 
throughout history of not only the world, but life itself. Jung was a scientist who 
believed in objective evidence. However, he felt strongly that the attempt to 
make psychology a statistical science was misguided. For him, a growth in 
consciousness is always a heroic effort by the individual, straining against the 
yoke of what everyone else assumes that they already know. Any growth in 
mass consciousness comes about through the effort of many such individuals. 
Consciousness develops in spurts, both in the individual and in the species. In 
the species, as long as our current level of understanding seems adequate to the 
problems at hand, little change occurs. But when new circumstances emerge, 
consciousness takes a jump. The collective unconscious contains information 
that can be accessed by anyone at any time. It appears to have no limits in time 
and space. That is, it can access information that was recorded by primitive 
people, or it can access information about events that have not yet taken place in 
your life. Consciousness, only a tiny part of the psyche, is not a recent scientific 
development as you may think, it is as old as the world, brought forward in the 
Vedas, and above all in the Bhagavad-Gita. Beneath it lays the personal 
unconscious and below that lays the vast expanse of the collective unconscious. 
All sensory experience is first filtered through the collective unconscious - 
archetypes {patterns, components) - which gather our life experiences that make 
up a complex to find the archetype within, like peeling away the layers of an 
onion. Archetypes are "components" of knowledge, "sources" of knowledge, 



and heavily involved with the "development" and "deployment" of our 
knowledge of reality. 

Long before Jung, the Gita associated all the above, that man has first to acquire 
the proper buddhi - perception and understanding - which makes him see the 
situation he faces in its proper perspective. The Gita emphasises this and the 
ways in which this can be achieved, but the sequence and the ways suggested 
may seem confusing and repetitive to the neophyte. Even Arjuna has to seek 
explanation and clarification several times all over the eighteen chapters. 
Krishna's long discourse is not merely a theoretical/metaphysical/psychological 
exposition, but goes beyond that and is even prescriptive. Three distinct 
disciplines are indicated, but it is important to note that these are far from being 
mutually exclusive and are in many respects complementary to one another. The 
three disciplines are: Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga. We all have 
some idea of what the term yoga means, a kind of intense discipline which 
enables one to control and strengthen the psychic potential which is ours. 

Jnana Yoga is the Yoga of Devotion to knowledge taught in the second and third 
discourse, accompanied with renunciation and reached by means of Karma 
Yoga, this Yoga in which the Vedic teaching regarding the life of activity and 
retirement (Pravrtti, the act of enjoying material and sensual pleasures, the 
natural tendency of human beings and Nivrtti, the act of abstaining from 
material and sensual enjoyment) is understood. It is this Yoga which forms the 
subject of the Supreme Lord's teaching throughout the Gita. Thinking, therefore, 
that the Vedic Teaching has been concluded, He extols it by relating its lineage. 

Bhakti Yoga as found in the twelfth discourse, Arjuna is supposed to have 
addressed the Supreme Lord in this way: In the discourses beginning with the 
second and ending with the tenth which treats of Divine Manifestations 
{Glories), You have taught the worship of the Supreme Self, the Imperishable 
(Akshara) Brahman, devoid of all conditions (upadhis): and You have also 
taught here and there the worship of Yourself as the Supreme Lord of the 
Universe, associated with the condition (upadhi) of that energy (sattva) which 
has the power of carrying on all evolutionary process and of knowing 
everything. And in the (eleventh) Discourse treating of the Universal From, 
Your Primal Form as Isvara manifesting itself as the whole universe has also 
been shown by You for the same purpose of worship. And having shown that 
Form, You have exhorted me to do works for Your sake only (Gita 11.55), and 
so on. Therefore, I ask of You with a desire to know which of these two ways is 
the better. Resumed: Bhakti Yoga is simply communicating with the Supreme 
Lord through devotional service. 



Karma Yoga is the path of God realisation through dedicating the fruits of one's 
work to the Supreme Lord. The two aspects of knowledge relating respectively 
to Pravrtti and Nivrtti, i.e., to the Path of Actions and the Path of Renunciation, 
with which the Gita-Sastra is concerned have been pointed out by the Supreme 
Lord in the Second Discourse. He has recommended renunciation of action to 
those who hold on the Sankhya-buddhi (Sankhya aspect of knowledge) and has 
added in Gita 2.72 that their end can be achieved by being devoted to that alone. 
And as to Arjuna, He has declared in Gita 2.47 that he should resort to actions 
(karma) alone as based on Yoga-buddhi (the Yoga aspect of knowledge), while it 
has not been said that the Highest Good can be attained by that alone. 

The Bhagavad-Gita is rich, and psychological, beautiful, full of poetic power. 
The characters stand out in heroic grandeur, in the midst of a magnificent setting 
of martial valour. The figures of Arjuna, very human in despondency and doubt, 
and of Krishna, majestic, resolute, persuasive, are clear, living, of universal, and 
truth of all religions. On the other side, the Gita is full inspiration, of religious 
devotion, and of keenest insight into the heart of man. The conflict of motives 
that overwhelmed human action, the clinging of fetters of selfishness which 
check us in the path to the immortal, the slight evasions of the lurking whisperer 
in the heart of man: all are clearly seen and clearly revealed. Yet, as a whole, the 
claims of abstract thought are not forgotten; every stage of Indian philosophy, 
every shade of logic, metaphysics and psychology, is given its place; and many 
practical suggestions are put forward, touching the problems of Indian politics 
and history, hints as valid today also in our Western world of human affairs as 
they were three thousand years ago. 

The leading events of the great Mahabharata war are historical. They have left a 
deep mark on all later ages of Indian life, down to our present day, also in the 
Western world. The great struggle between family members of the Rajput race 
recorded there, permanently weakened that race, and overshadowed its glory, so 
making way for the long dominance of the Brahmans priesthood. The growth of 
the Brahman power forms, as it were, a measure of the passage of ages in 
ancient India. In the archaic of the first Upanishads, we find the sacred 
knowledge wholly in the hands of the Rajputs, the royal races of the same kind, 
as it would seem, to the ancient Egyptians and Chaldeans. Two of the 
Upanishads record the first initiation of a Brahman into that knowledge. The 
initiator, a princely Rajput, marks the occasion by declaring that this knowledge 
had never before been given to a Brahman, but in every region was the 
hereditary teaching of the, the Ksatriya warrior alone. 

In the days of the Mahabbarata war, the Brahmans have already gained much 
ground, but they are far from being the strong and dominant caste they later 
became. There are many instances in which the privileges and dignity of 



Brahmans are somewhat abruptly treated; and in many cases, as in the marriages 
of the Pandu brothers, Brahmanical law is broken in a way that would be 
unimaginable later on. There is abundant evidence that it was precisely this great 
fratricidal struggle among the Rajput princes that gave the Brahmans their 
opportunity, opening the way for the consolidation of their power. 

In the days of Prince Siddhartha, also a Rajput of the Solar race, the hierarchical 
priesthood was not only grown strong and great all over northern India, but, in 
many regards, it had fallen into over ripeness and decline. One of the Buddha's 
most eloquent sermons is directed against the manifold abuses of the Brahman 
order, and preserves for us a picture, unsparing in its satire, and perfect in detail, 
of the life of the Brahmans, in spiritual and external matters alike, in the 
Buddha's day. As we know that the Buddha's long life was lived some twenty- 
five hundred years ago, we can easily see that the epoch of the Great War, in 
which Krishna and Arjuna fought, must have been centuries earlier; and far 
beyond the time of the Great War lie the archaic days of the greater Upanishads. 

Generally, we may say that no man who has been well forgotten suddenly 
becomes the hero of a popular poem. The very essence of ballads and bardic 
songs is that they record toughly deeds still fresh in all memories; and, the world 
over, the bards have gained glory and reward by singing the praises of warriors, 
and the beauty of queens, at the courts of queens and warriors they celebrated, or 
at least before their children, who shone in their reflected glory. We are justified 
in believing that every bardic poem, every ballad marked some hero, was in the 
first instance genuinely contemporary, though many later changes may have 
been made. In addition, this is true, no doubt, of the cycle of ballads and bardic 
poems which form the essence of the Mahabharata. They were made in the first 
instance while the echoes of the Great War were in all men's ears; while the 
victors were still flushed with victory; while the wreaths were still fresh on the 
tombs of the fallen. Moreover, among those ballads there was one, if we may 
trust the great cyclic poem itself as we certainly do, which recorded the 
"Despondency of Arjuna in sight of the armies, and the wise and eternal words 
of Truth by which the Supreme Lord Krishna stirred him to battle. 

This poem called, "The Song of God", the dialogue between the Supreme Lord 
Krishna and Arjuna, made soon after the battle, no doubt, formed the seed of the 
present work of eighteen chapters or 700 verses. To that, many elements were 
added, and its growth followed the growth of Indian life throughout the 
centuries. Gradually developed and perfected in form, it came at last to stand as 
a symbolic scripture, with many meanings, containing many truths. This 
development has taken place, in a large degree, by weaving together the 
different threads of Indian thought, the work of the great lines of Indian 
tradition. 



There is but one problem of life; throughout the world, in all ages, it has been 
the same. It is the problem of the soul, in this life embodied, and its immortality 
as entity. From difference of temperament or race, or both, there have been 
certain widely divergent lines in the effort of ancient India to solve this 
immemorial secret. Each had its growth and development; each its long line of 
adherents; each its controversies, its commentators, its triumphs. In course of 
time, the difference between these systems grew more marked than their 
agreement, and controversies overshadowed appreciation. One great task of the 
Bhagavad Gita is that of reconciler between these divergent systems, and the 
revelation of the truth that they all lead to a single goal. 

The teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita is of inspiration, of intuition, of faith, is the 
inspiring spirit of the Upanishads, to which the name of Vedanta, the end of the 
Veda, was, in due time, given. In historic origin, it is the sacred tradition of the 
Rajputs; and the Rajputs derived from it the twin teachings of rebirth and 
liberation, which formed the heart of their secret teaching. They taught that the 
psychical, personal man might follow either one of two contrasted destinies. He 
might remain under the bend of his bodily longings and desires, and blind to the 
greater spiritual life above him; a man amongst men, and with all the weakness 
and failings of poor humanity. 

The Bhagavad-Gita relates the brooding presence of the greater Self, who, in 
truth, guides the cycle of births of the souls, and lead them along the different 
ways of many lives (if need be). Man must know that he is not alone in this wild 
world, but that he is guarded, watched, and provided for, and that the guardian is 
his own divine Self. Feeling this, he comes to a dark and difficult region of the 
Path. Personal desires, relationship, claims besetting him, and all the longings of 
personal life must be left off forever. Moreover, the immortal claims overwhelm 
him also, very importunate, demanding perfect sacrifice, and pointing to a path 
that leads away from the level places of the world. Then comes the great and 
immemorial conflict between the personal and divine will, between the man's 
self and his better or Higher Self. The price of victory is liberation, and 
liberation is immortal life, in the sunlight of the Eternal One. This is the great 
teaching of the greater Upanishads, and this is the conflict to which the Supreme 
Lord Krishna urges Arjuna. 

The author or authors of the Bhagavad-Gita set themselves to describe the great 
conflict, and to show in what way each of the powers may help toward victory 
of one's own life. The personal man begins to feel the greater Self above him, 
with its insistent inner, silent voice, but its brooding power. About him is the 
furniture of his everyday life, to which he is bound by many dear, close ties, 
many things that can be threading, if he is to follow that new and imperious 



"silent voice within" and above "within", many things are visibly condemned 
because of detachment. Worldly success, attachment to wealth, ambition, 
regards and consideration, how will these stand if the great silent voice were 
obeyed? He will have to set out on a path not that of those attached to the world 
as many of these things must be laid aside as one goes forward. How shall he 
apply to the task? How make even the first resolve to undertake it? How shall he 
substitute for the various coloured lights of the world, the quiet light of the soul? 
These are the questions sought to be answered in the Bhagavad-Gita, and 
nothing more dramatic could be imagined that the position of the Supreme Lord 
Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefields, which is made the occasion of its 
answers. 

At what time was the Bhagavad-Gita written? If we are correct in holding the 
views already suggested in other works, it was written at different times, through 
several centuries, growing gradually to fuller and fuller completeness. Even a 
number of Biblical books as in the Old Testament took many centuries and 
writers before it was finally composed. I have in mind the book of Isaiah that 
was written by a number of writers within the span of 400 years. Also, were the 
five first books of the Bible, called the Pentateuch, traditionally allocated to 
Moses, written by a number of unknown authors (named A,B,C,D), as well over 
many centuries. 

The evidence is that poem, song, ballad of the Supreme Lord Krishna and 
Arjuna, which must have been composed soon after the great battle of 
Kuruksetra; and so layer after layer was added, as the ages passed. In the days of 
Shankaracharya, the work was already complete, in its present form. Shankara 
lived, according to the traditions of the schools he founded in Southern India, 
some twenty-two hundred years ago. However, we must put the Bhagavad Gita 
somewhat further back, even in its complete and final form. For some two 
centuries before the date assigned to great Shankara, Patanjali lived and taught, 
recording in the Yoga Sutras the sum and essence of his philosophy. Moreover, 
these Sutras are evidently later and more developed than the Bhagavad Gita, and 
are indeed, the final summing up of that long tradition of Yoga teaching, many 
aspects of which are spoken of in this poem. Patanjali was in all probability, a 
contemporary of Gautama, the Buddha, who lived some five and twenty 
centuries ago. In addition, the fact that there is no clear trace of the Buddha's 
mission in the Gita is another reason for assigning it, even in its final form, to an 
earlier date. We shall, maybe, come closest to the truth, if we think of the 
Bhagavad Gita as really and truly recording the teaching and mission of the 
Supreme Lord Krishna, though with certain added themes; and of His mission as 
but one in a long series of revelations through Rajput sages, which made and 
continued the spiritual life of India. 



So, in archaic times, we have the greater Upanishads, with their teachings of the 
royal sages, teachings hitherto imparted to Brahman, as two of the great 
Upanishads declare; and in Vedic times also we have the hymns of the Rajput 
Vishvamitra, seer of the third Mandala of the Rig Veda, wherein is contained the 
holy Gayatri. After Vishvamitra and the Upanishads, we have the Rama of 
Ayodya, esteemed a divine avatar; and, after Rama, Prince Krishna of Dvaraka, 
hero, sage and seer of Rajput race. The Supreme Lord Krishna himself insists on 
this, at the beginning of the fourth book of the Bhagavad Gita: 

The Supreme Lord said: I taught this changeless way of Yoga to 
Vivasvan; Vivasvan told it to Manu and Manu to Iksvaku. (4.01) 
So, was the oral tradition from one to another handed on to the Royal 
Sages who came to know it, O Parantapa (O Vanquisher of Foes/Arjuna); 
but, after a considerable time, this teaching of Yoga ceased to be in the 
world. (4.02) 

Then, in the fullness of time, if we are correct, prince Siddhartha the 
Compassionate, himself a descendant of Iksvaku, once more gave forth to the 
world the Rajput sacred teaching, enriched as of old by two teachings of rebirth 
and liberation from rebirth, to which, following the older Indian tradition 
already recorded in the Bhagavad-Gita, the Awakened Siddhartha gave the 
splendid name of Nirvana. 

This great teaching summarised in the Bhagavad-Gita, so handed down from the 
Supreme Lord to the devotee, forms the living heart of Eastern philosophy, and 
today of the remainder of the world, and as a tribute to this knowledge, the 
rendering of the Gita is made. 

The "Self is not limited by our expectations of morality; our concerns are not 
necessarily Its concerns. This amoral, inhuman aspect of the Self is far too 
frequently overlooked by people who talk blithely about finding the Higher Self. 
This was an issue that occupied Carl Gustav Jung throughout his life. He dealt 
with it most fully in a very late essay, "Answer to Job." Jung examined Job's 
behaviour toward God and God's behaviour toward Job, and found Job came out 
the winner. God was presented as a petulant and irrational tyrant, while Job was 
both loyal and thoughtful. Jung felt that the story of Job marked a turning point 
in consciousness when God was forced to acknowledge Job as his moral 
superior. God was for the first time forced to consider the possibility of a true 
relationship with mankind-which would eventually lead to the appearance of a 
world saviour, who combined God and man in a single being. 

So, we have arrived at the idea of "unattached action": of persons so established 
in identification with the "Self that in the middle of tireless service of those 



10 



around them, they remain in inner peace, the silent witness of action. They do 
not act, says the Gita; it is the Self that acts through them: "He who perceives 
that Prakriti (matter, nature) performs all actions, and that the Self (Atma) 
engages not in actions, he sees indeed." (See also 3.27, 5.09 and 14.19) (13.29) 

Meister Eckhart says eloquently: Whoever has God in mind, simply and solely 
God, in all things, such a man carries God with him into all his works and in all 
places, and God alone does all his works. He seeks nothing but God; nothing 
seems good to him but God. He becomes one with God in every thought. Just as 
no multiplicity can dissipate God, so nothing can dissipate this man or make him 
multiple. 

The Supreme Lord Krishna says: Therefore, at all times only remember Me and 
fight. With mind and intellect fixed on Me, you will without doubt come to Me. 
(8.07) 

The Bhagavad-Gita today 

That was several thousand years ago, and today the Bhagavad-Gita is found in 
every household in India and has been translated into every major language of 
the world. Literally billions of copies have been handwritten and printed. 

What is the appeal of the Bhagavad-Gita? First of all, it is totally practical, free 
of any vague or abstract philosophy. During my first trip to India over forty 
years ago, I heard about a yogi who lived in a small houseboat on the Ganges 
river in the holy city of Benares (Varanasi). He never spoke or wrote; yet every 
day for many years people came to him for advice. How did he manage? He had 
a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita, and after he was told the problem or question he 
would open the book and point to a portion. And the inquirer would have a 
perfect and complete solution to the trouble. 

My own spiritual awakening began by kicking me out of the nest of the 
comfortable Roman Catholic Faith into a vaster world of realities. I floundered 
around in the sea of my new horizons until one day I bought a hardboard edition 
of the Bhagavad-Gita, by Ramananda Prasad, Ph.D. I did not read it, I inhaled it. 
Through it, the Eternal Self spoke Eternal Truth to me within my inner-self. The 
Bhagavad-Gita changed my life by giving me Life, indeed. That very "Life" that 
has never ended ever since I opened the Sacred Book, "The Song of God". I 
worked every since with the American Gita Society, and translated Ramananda 
Prasad version into French and Dutch. After, I also translated into English my 
own version of the Bhagavad-Gita. 



11 



Nothing has ever arisen in my life, internal or external, that the Bhagavad-Gita 
has not made clear and enabled me to deal with or understand. Yet is it not 
dogmatic. At the very end Krishna says to Arjuna: "Now I have taught you that 
wisdom which is the secret of secrets. Ponder it carefully. Then act as you think 
best." 

No threats, no promises, no coercion. It is all in the reader's hands. Even better: 
the Bhagavad-Gita tells us that we can attain a Knowing beyond even what it 
tells us. And, the Bhagavad-Gita shows us the way, quite sufficient for the 
salvation of the Soul, the Higher-Self. 

Conclusion 

The battle commences and Arjuna and his brothers, the Pandavas, ultimately 
win. Significantly, the Bhagavad-Gita itself ends before we know the battle's 
outcome. The question of who wins and who looses is not the issue in the Gita. 
Nor does the Bhagavad-Gita really solved the problem of war. The two sides are 
not identified as good or as bad. There is no clear favourites here. War is, by 
almost any standard, tragic, according to the Bhagavad-Gita. And yet, the 
context of war is significant in the Gita because the battlefield is really a 
metaphor for the soul itself, the mind and its struggle. 

Ordinary Hindus wrestling with the issues of dharma is a much more present 
reality than the subjects of the Vedas or even the Upanishads. As a metaphor for 
the Self and its eternal struggles, perhaps the Bhagavad-Gita is a reminder that 
often there are no clear avenues of choice. Our decisions must be made in 
ambiguity and uncertainty. 

The Bhagavad-Gita and Transcendental Consciousness 

The Bhagavad-Gita is the Light of Life. It is there to save humanity from the 
darkness of ignorance and suffering. 

The word "Bhagavad" means Lord, which signifies the state of self-referral 
intelligence, which is also referred to as Krishna, Brahma and totality. The word 
Gita means Song. 

The Bhagavad-Gita is the voice of totality, the voice of the infinite organizing 
power of Natural Law. Its purpose is to explain all that is needed to raise our 
consciousness to the highest possible level.

The Bhagavad Gita consisting of 700 verses, each one giving invaluable insight 
into how to live life in the most spiritual and successful way. The Bhagavad- 
Gita is therefore a complete guide to practical life. 

The Essence of the Bhagavad-Gita 

The Bhagavad-Gita has a greater number of commentaries than any other known 
scriptures. Most of these have not brought to light the essential teaching of this 
precious knowledge. 

The Bhagavad-Gita has been beautifully translated and the translator gives a 
very complete and easy to understand commentary. 

For example, Chapter 2, verse 45 tells us: 

trai-gunya-visaya veda nistrai-gunyo bhavarjuna 
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho niryoga-ksema atmavan (2.45) 

trai-gunya visayah - deal with the three attributes, pertaining to the three 
modes of material nature; visayah â€” on the subject matter; vedah - Vedas, 
Vedic literatures; nistrai-gunyah - without these three attributes (gunas); 
bhava â€” be; arjuna â€” O Arjuna; nirdvandvah - free from the pairs of 
opposite, without duality; nitya-sattva-sthah - ever remaining in the 
Sattva (goodness), a nice thought: 'in a pure state of spiritual existence'; 
niryoga-ksemah - free from (the thought of) acquisition and preservation; 
atma-van â€” established in the self. 

Harmony and Fulfilment 

The Vedas cover the three Gunas of Nature. Be, O Arjuna, above the three 
Gunas, free from pairs of opposites (dualities), unconcerned with 
acquisition and preservation, always firm in goodness, and centred in the 
Self. (2.45) 

This verse teaches us that all influences of the outside world, and their 
consequences as well, will cling to us as long as we are out of our Self 
(Transcendental Consciousness). Once we are in that state of the Self, we will 
find eternal harmony and fulfilment. 

The three gunas, called "sattva, rajas and tamas", are the forces that constitute 
life in the relative (changing) field. When we are out of the field of the three 
gunas, we are in a non-changing state of perfect harmony and silence, which is 
our Self, the state of Yoga. This is pure consciousness, the home of all the laws 
of nature in every one of us.

Unifying quality of Natural Law 

The Bhagavad-Gita is that part of the Vedic Literature which deals with the 
unifying quality of Natural Law. It asks us to act from the level of non-action, 
the state of Yoga. Yoga means unity, oneness, which is our Self, or 
Transcendental Consciousness. 

This brings us to another very important verse in the Bhagavad-Gita. It is 
Chapter 2, verse 48 which explains the fundamental skill in action: "Yogasthah 
Kuru Karmani - Established in Yoga, perform action". 

Performing Action from the state of Yoga 

The translator tells us that when we perform action from the state of Yoga, self- 
referral consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness, then that action is 
performed by the infinite organizing power of Natural Law. 

The infinite organizing power of Natural Law organises everything in the 
universe in perfect order and harmony. If we are able to be active from the level 
of Yoga, unity, oneness, pure singularity, or Transcendental Consciousness, then 
every action leads to success and fulfilment. 

Action from that level does not consume energy. It revitalises and therefore 
gives energy. Every action that we perform from the level of infinite organizing 
power within, is spontaneously done with the least amount of effort. 

If we perform an action from the state of Yoga, we spontaneously perform right 
action, action which is in accord with Natural Law. (in accord with "dharma", 
which is that invincible power of nature which upholds evolution) 

The State of Yoga is not far distant from us 

The state of Yoga is Transcendental Consciousness. This Supreme State of 
Existence is not far distant from us. It is within ourselves and therefore always 
within our reach. It is our own Self, nothing other than our own Self. 

For this reason we don't need to go far to find that glorified state. We only have 
to experience the most settled state of awareness, which is pure silence, 
"Transcendental Consciousness", at the source of thought. 

This is done in a completely effortless and natural way through appropriate 
meditation techniques, which was introduced to the world by a number of 
outstanding Hindu Gurus. This technique has been verified in the lives of 



14

Life in Perfection as taught in the Gita 

The essence of the Bhagavad-Gita is to experience the inner field of pure 
silence, self-referral consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness within. If we 
start our day's activity with a technique that effortlessly refers our mind back to 
this state of non-action, then this source of all action, of all dynamism, will 
automatically be infused into our daily activities. This will result in life in 
accord with Natural Law, life in accord with the invincible, evolutionary power 
of dharma, leading us towards supreme quality of life, life in perfection, in 
enlightenment and bliss.

Consciousness along Carl Gustav Jung 



Consciousness 



Personal 
Unconcious 



Collective 
Unconcious 




Along Carl Gustav Jung, the structure of the "embodied man", the psyche. Consciousness is 
only a tiny part of the psyche, beneath it lies the personal unconscious and below that lies the 
vast expanse of the collective unconscious. All sensory experience is first filtered through the 
building blocks of the collective unconscious - the archetypes - which gather our life 
experiences around them to form complexes.

Dr. Roberto Assagiloi 's Egg, exploring "consciousness " in a systematic way. 



16 



Consciousness is our knowing that we know; that phase of knowing by which 
we take cognizance of our existence and of our relation to what we call 
environment. Environment is made by ideas held in mind and objectified. The 
ideas that are held in mind are the basis of all consciousness. The nature of the 
ideas upon which consciousness is formed gives character to it. Consciousness, 
the direct awareness: the incessant flow of sensation, images, thoughts, feelings, 
desires, and impulses, which one can observe, analyse, and judge. 

The subconscious mind, or subjective consciousness, is the sum of all man's 
past thinking. It may be called memory. The subconscious sometimes acts 
separately from the conscious mind, for instance, in dreams and in its work of 
carrying in bodily functions, such as breathing and digestion. The subconscious 
mind has no power to do original thinking. It acts upon what is given it through 
the conscious or the subconscious mind. All our involuntary or automatic 
activities are of the subconscious mind, they are the result of our having trained 
ourselves by the conscious mind to form certain habits and do certain things 
without having to centre our thought upon them consciously. 

Personal consciousness is formed from limited, selfish ideas. 

Sense consciousness is a mental state formed from believing in and acting 
through the senses. It is the serpent consciousness, deluded with sensation. 
Since an individual becomes attached to whatever he thinks about, the result of 
his forming sense consciousness is that he withdraws his consciousness from the 
Supreme Being, and looses conscious connection with his Source. 

Material consciousness is much the same as personal and sense consciousness. 
It is a state of mind based on belief in the reality of materiality, or in things as 
they appear. 

The conscious self or the "I", the point within the embodied of pure self- 
awareness, different from the changing content of our consciousness (the 
sensations, thoughts, feelings, and more). 



The superconsciousness, or superconscious mind, is the Higher Self, a state of 
consciousness that is based on true ideas, upon an understanding and realisation 
of the Oneness of Truth as related in the Bhagavad-Gita. 

The Higher Self, or the "Self with a capital letter, submerged in the 
ceaseless flow of psychological contents, disappearing (walking away as 
it were) when we fall asleep, when we faint, when we are under the effect 



17 



of an anaesthetic or narcotic, or in a state of hypnosis, and when one 
awakes the "Self is appearing again. 



The Collective Consciousness. According to Jung, consciousness, seemingly 
the sine qua non of humanity is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath 
consciousness lies a much larger substratum of forgotten or repressed personal 
memories, feelings and behaviours, which Jung termed the personal 
unconscious. Moreover, beneath that lies the deep sea of collective unconscious, 
huge and ancient (Brahman), filled with all the images and behaviours (souls, 
entities) that have been repeated over and over (reincarnation) throughout the 
history of not only humanity, but also life itself (all creation). As Jung said: "... 
the deeper you go, the broader the base becomes." 

The Collective Consciousness consists of images and behavioural patterns not 
acquired by an individual in his or her lifetime, yet accessible to all individuals 
in all times, "unconscious" because it cannot be reached through conscious 
awareness. Here is faith and intent, prayer, meditation, Gita standards essential 
to open ourselves up to the universal but hidden treasure. The collective 
unconscious or consciousness (as I prefer to say) dwells in each of us. Much of 
our life is structured by the archetypal symbols that are the organised units of the 
collective unconscious (consciousness).

Summary of the Discourses of the Bhagavad-Gita 

First Discourse 

Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra - The Hopelessness of 
Arjuna. 

As the opposing armies stand ready for battle, Arjuna, the mighty warrior, sees 
his intimate relatives, teachers and friends in both armies ready to fight and 
sacrifice their lives. Overwhelmed by sorrow and pity, Arjuna fails in strength, 
his mind becomes confused, and he gives up his will-power to fight. 

One may fear his highest possibilities (as well as his lowest ones). He may be 
afraid to become that which he can glimpse in his most perfect moments, under 
the most perfect conditions, under conditions of courage. He may enjoy and 
even thrill to the godlike possibilities he sees in himself in such peak moments 
as on the battlefield of Kuruksetra. And yet he simultaneously shivers with 
weakness, awe and fear before these same possibilities. 

The Sanskrit root of the word 'dharma' is 'dhr', to 'hold'. Who holds us? The 
'Supreme'. What holds us? 'Truth'. Dharma prevails. If not always, ultimately it 
must, for in 'dharma' is the Breath of the Supreme Being. Our body's dharma is 
service, our mind's dharma is illumination, our heart's dharma is oneness and 
out soul's dharma is liberation. 

Second Discourse 

Contents of the Gita Summarised - Sankhya Theory and Yoga Practices 

Arjuna presents to the Supreme Lord Krsna as His devotee; and, the Supreme 
Lord begins His teachings to Arjuna by explaining the fundamental distinction 
between the temporary transient body and the eternal embodied soul. The 
Supreme Lord explains the process of transmigration, the nature of selfless 
service to the Supreme and the characteristics of a self -realised or actualised 
person, and these are: Perception of reality; acceptance, spontaneity; problem 
centring; the need for solitude (self-realised people do not need others in the 
ordinary sense, though many of them like to be with others); autonomy; peak 
experiences (spontaneous mystical experiences are common); human kinship; 
humility and respect; interpersonal relationships); means and ends; authenticity; 
integration; non-violence (Mahatma Gandhi); vision; the Higher self; 
intentionality; presence and openness. What is life? It is the soul's only 
opportunity to manifest and fulfil the Divine here on earth. When life begins its 
journey on earth, the Supreme Being shakes hands with it. When the journey is 



19 



half won, Eternity shakes hands with it. When life's journey is complete, 
Immortality shakes hands with it. Life lives the live of perfection when it lives 
in spirituality. 

Third Discourse 

Karma-yoga - The Yoga of Action 

Everyone must engage in some kind of activity in this tangible world of ours. 
But actions can either bind one to this world or liberate one from it. By acting 
for the pleasure of the Supreme Being, without selfish motives, one can be 
liberated from the law of karma (action and reaction) and attain Self-knowledge 
of the Higher Self within, and the Supreme Being. We must examine our 
motives with all sincerity. We often discover that the reasons for our 
preoccupation with helping others are not as pure and noble as we thought. We 
soon discover that the shining alloy, mixed with gold, is also containing the base 
metal of vanity, presumption, proselytism, as well as the desire to appease our 
conscience so that we will have some excuse for not undertaking the hard work 
of inner purification. 

Fourth Discourse 

Jnana- Yoga- The Yoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge 

Transcendental knowledge â€” the spiritual knowledge of the soul, of Supreme 
Being, and of their relationship â€” is both purifying and liberating. Such 
knowledge is the fruit of selfless devotional action (karma-yoga). The Supreme 
Lord explains the distant history of the Bhagavad Glta, the purpose and 
significance of His periodic descents to the transient world, and the necessity of 
approaching a guru, a realized teacher. The need for a teacher is essential in 
spirituality, as one must take great care in this area, and that is not advisable for 
those who lack the appropriate spiritual preparation in trying to become a 
realised person. Do not forget that 'spirituality' means, in fact, working with 
supernormal powers. Sacrifice is the secret of self-dedicated service. Life's duty, 
performed with a spontaneous flow of self-offering to humanity under the 
express guidance of the inner' being, can alone transform life into beauty. 

Fifth Discourse 

Samnyasa-Yoga - The Yoga of Action with Renunciation 

Outwardly performing all actions but inwardly renouncing their fruits, the wise 
man, purified by the fire of spiritual knowledge, attains peace, detachment, 
patience, spiritual vision and happiness. Selflessly spending oneself for others 



20 



and serving mankind should be one of the greatest sources of joy. The first 
benefit is that it causes us to forget ourselves, releasing us from the 'steel box' 
of our personality. The real sense of inner satisfaction drives from unattached 
service to those around, and that is great. Action and renunciation are identical. 
Action is the tree. Renunciation is the fruit thereof. One cannot be greater than 
the other. The tree and the fruit grow in the bosom of the Supreme Being to be 
loved by Eternity and embraced by Immortality. 

Sixth Discourse 

Dhyana-yoga - The Yoga of Meditation 

Dhyana-yoga, a meditative practise, controls the mind and senses and focuses 
concentration on Paramatma (the Supersoul, God, Para-Brahma). This practice 
culminates in Samddhi, the full consciousness of the Supreme. The discourse 
teaches the man of renunciation to commune with the Supreme Being as his first 
duty; and then to perform all proper physical, mental, moral, and spiritual duties 
with divine consciousness, directed by Him alone. Before all activity, there is a 
need for silence, and that is through meditation. Dhyana-yoga is not a matter of 
outward asceticism, but a purely internal self-discipline of calm inner silence, 
conscious reflection, proper meditation, prayer and contemplation - in short, all 
those essential elements of spiritual work deep within. Meditation is not only a 
preparation for external action, but an indispensable means for inspiration and 
renewal. Meditation is a source of spiritual nourishment. This is the clear way of 
the Bhagavad GTta, posing and resolving the problem of action, and relates how 
the ancient sages of India had reached the same conclusions as the Christians 
saints. From simple meditation, through perseverance one reaches higher states 
of meditation and contemplation, eventually discovering the Supreme Light. A 
devotee always remains in the breath of his Supreme Lord. For him there is no 
true fall, no destruction, no death. 

Seventh Discourse 

Vynana - Yoga- The Yoga of Knowledge and Realisation 

The Supreme Lord Krsna is the Absolute Truth, the supreme cause and 
sustaining force of everything, both material and spiritual. Advanced embodied- 
souls surrender unto Him in devotion, whereas impious living souls divert their 
minds to other objects of worship. The path of yoga is only a means to reach the 
Supreme Goal. When one communes with the Supreme Lord, the technique of 
any yoga mentioned in the GTta has fulfilled its purpose. However, as many do 
today in this modern world, one cannot practise yoga techniques, while 
forgetting the Supreme Lord. Yoga is communion with the Supreme. 



21 



Noble and exalted are all these, but the man of knowledge, do I regard as My 

very Self; for his self integrated, is fixed on Me, the highest goal. (See also 9.29) 

(7.18) 

At the close of many births, the man of knowledge takes refuge in Me, 

concluding that Vasudeva's son (Krsna) is all. Such a noble soul (Mahatma) is 

very rare. (7.19) 

Eighth Discourse 

Abhyasa - Yoga - The Yoga of the Imperishable Brahman 

By remembering the Supreme Lord Krsna in devotion throughout one's life, and 
especially at the time of death, one can attain to His supreme abode, beyond the 
material world. "Abhyasa-yoga" is the repetitive effort to hold the mind 
continuously in its pure state of divine attunement. Success in Self-realisation 
depends on one's spiritual activity. The true devotee knows the real value of 
incessant and regular meditation, by which his life becomes a permanent prayer. 
Yoga practise should never be done mechanically or from an oppressive sense of 
duty, or just out of habit, but with intent, joy and perpetual zeal, so causing each 
meditation session to yield more and more a deeper bliss. What is within will 
sooner or later be manifested without. The possessor of divine thoughts will also 
be the doer of divine deeds. It is possible only for a dedicated man to think of 
the Supreme Lord consciously while leaving the earth scene. 

Ninth Discourse 

The Sovereign Knowledge and Big Secret 

The Supreme Lord Krsna is the Supreme Godhead and the supreme object of 
worship. The soul is eternally related to Him through devotional service 
(bhakti). By reviving one's pure devotion one returns to the Supreme Lord in the 
spiritual realm. The devotee who, through the ways of yoga described in the 
GTta, becomes established in Self-realisation possesses the all-knowing intuitive 
knowledge of direct perception that penetrates the core of the big secret of how 
the Supreme Lord is at once both immanent and transcendent. Realising his own 
oneness with the Supreme Being, the yogi understands that he himself is the 
microcosm in the macrocosm of immanence and transcendence. He lives, moves 
and has his being in this world, never losing the awareness that he is an 
'embodied soul', and that he is continually confronted with a 'goal' choice. 



22 



Tenth Discourse 
Divine Manifestations 

All wondrous phenomena showing power, beauty, grandeur or sovereignty, 
either in the material world or in the spiritual, are but partial manifestations of 
Krsna's divine energies and magnificence. As the supreme cause of all causes 
and the support and essence of everything, Krsna is the supreme object of 
worship for all beings. All mental states and all inner and outer conditionings of 
mankind have a divine purpose. The Supreme 's all-conquering power whatever 
His manifestation is made apparent in right actions, gracious motives and goals. 
The Supreme Being is the uncreated silence, hidden in all forces and objects of 
cosmic nature. We see only the gross expression that 'maya' displays, not quite 
the hidden mystery. The Supreme 's silent 'Presence' within each one of us, and 
everything is a well-kept secret, however, discoverable by no limited human 
mind filled with good will. Self-knowledge is the knowledge of universal 
oneness. Divine perfection can be founded only in fertile soil of universal 
oneness. Serve humanity precisely because Divinity appears majestically in 
humanity. Knowing Divinity an acting upon, one will in no time come to self- 
realisation. 



Eleventh Discourse 
Vision of the Cosmic Form 

The Supreme Lord Krsna grants Arjuna divine vision and reveals His 
spectacular unlimited form as the cosmic universe. So, He conclusively 
establishes His divinity. The Supreme Lord explains that His own all-beautiful 
humanlike form is the original form of Godhead. One can perceive this form 
only by pure devotional service. The Supreme Lord is interested in the devotee's 
true devotion to Him, no matter sincere concept formulates the worship. The 
devotee who realises a personal God in a form will eventually realise Him as the 
Formless, Omnipresent and Infinite Reality, Divine Energy. The vision of the 
Cosmic Form acts as a powerful stimulus, an unfailing comfort, and an 
inexhaustible source of power and courage. Let us try in our imagination and 
meditation to form a vivid picture of the glory and bliss of the victorious, 
liberated embodied soul as it consciously participates in the wisdom, power and 
love of the Divine Life, the Greater Vision. When one meditates, he not only 
enters that greater vision of the Supreme, but also the vision of a redeemed 
humanity, the whole creation regenerated and displaying the perfection of the 
Supreme Being. It is visions like this that have enabled mystics of all times and 
saints of East and West to smile as they endured their inner and physical 
austerities. 



23 



Twelfth Discourse 

Bhakti-Yoga - The Yoga of Devotion 

Bhakti-yoga, pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord Krsna, is the highest 
and most fitting means for attaining pure love for Krsna, which is the highest 
end of spiritual existence. Those who follow this supreme goal develop divine 
qualities. The Bhagavad GTta, the 'Song of the Supreme' is also a hymn of 
gratitude raised to Brahma, the Creator of such cosmic magnificence (both 
heaven and earth), and our hearts burn with an unspeakable devotional love for 
Him, and all His creatures. Totally absorbed in this vision and in these feelings, 
the embodied soul forgets itself. Yogis who attain this perception of the 
Supreme find that this realisation leads to final emancipation. The true state of 
meditation is oneness of the one who meditates with the object of meditation, 
the Supreme Being. Here the devotee experiences the peace of the Supreme 
Infinite. 



Thirteenth Discourse 

The Field and the Knower (Matter and Spirit) 

One who understands the difference between the body, the soul and the 
Supersoul beyond them both attains liberation from this material world. Loving 
devotion is more than enough to realise the Supreme Lord Krsna, the Eternal 
Truth. However, in this discourse the Lord Krsna wants to widen Arjuna's 
knowledge, philosophically and intellectually. Matter and Spirit (Prakrti and 
Purusa), the Field and the Knower of the Field. They both are Beginningless. 
Matter as primordial substance, is ever changing, while Purusa (Spirit) is static, 
unmovable. In this chapter we do observe that the GTta is at once the 
significance of life and the divine interpretation of life. He is a liberated 
embodied soul who sees the Supreme Lord in all creatures and in all creation. 
To escape through knowledge from the oppressive narrowness of unbelief, and 
the human self into blissful omnipresence of the Self (Higher Self) is the goal of 
human life. 

Fourteenth Discourse 

The Three Gunas of Nature 

All embodied souls are under the control of the three modes, constituents or 
qualities, of material nature: goodness, passion and ignorance. The Supreme 



24 



Lord explains what these modes are, how they act upon us, how one transcends 
them, and the symptoms of one who has attained the transcendental stage. Sattva 
is goodness, is purity, light and wisdom. Divine bliss (happiness) stay together. 
The senses in Sattva are surcharged with the light of knowledge. The goal is the 
abode of the sages. Rajas are passion, desire, unlit activity. Rajas binds the body 
to action. Restlessness and Rajas breathe together. To separate action from Rajas 
is practically impossible. If one dies when Rajas prevails, then he is reborn 
among those attached to action. Tamas is ignorance, and darkness. Stagnation 
and Tamas stay together Futility and Tamas breathe together. Death in Tamas is 
followed by rebirth among the senseless fools. Sattva offers to mankind at large 
luminous Knowledge; Rajas, passionate greed; and, Tamas, rank delusion. The 
yogi who has transcended the three constituents of Nature in his own life will 
neither hate nor grave for the fruits of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. 

Fifteenth Discourse 

The Yoga of the Supreme Self 

The ultimate purpose of Vedic knowledge is to detach oneself from the 
entanglement of the material world and to understand the Supreme Lord Krsna 
as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who understands Krsna's supreme 
identity surrenders unto Him and engages in His devotional service. This 
discourse begins with a tree. This tree is called the world-tree. Unlike earthly 
and botanical trees, this tree has its roots above in the Supreme Being. The 
Supreme Being is the only Source. Downward are its branches spread. The 
Vedas are its leaves. He who has understood the depths of the ever-changing and 
ever-evolving world has all the Vedic knowledge at his disposal. Purusottama 
(The Supreme Lord) is beyond formlessness and form, beyond impersonality 
and personality. In Him the mightiest dynamic urge and the profoundest silence 
stay together. Terms to remember: (1) Yama, moral conduct, non-violence, 
truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and none desire (lust). (2) Niyama : purity 
of mind and body, contentment in all circumstances, self-discipline, self- 
knowledge, and devotion to the Supreme. (3) Asana: right posture in meditation; 
the spinal column must be held straight, and the body firm in a comfortable 
position for meditation. (4) Pranayama : life-force (Prana) control. (5) 
Pratyahara : the power of interiorising one's mind by disconnecting from the 
affairs of this world, meaning switching off from the nerve currents. (6) 
Dharana : meditation in which the devotee is able to hold fast to his interiorised 
mind on the Aum sound, the primal manifestation of the Supreme. (See our 
'Omnic Meditation outline' ) The sense enslaved man does not own or control 
his mind; so he cannot concentrate on the 'Aum' (OM) Vibratory Sacred Sound. 
(7) Dhyana : through meditation towards the cosmic consciousness, with its 
endless spherical expansion of blissful awareness; perception of the Supreme 



25 



Being as the Cosmic Aum (OM) reverberating throughout the whole universe. 
(8) Samadhi : oneness of the embodied soul and (the Cosmic and Supreme 
Being. 

Sixteenth Discourse 

The Divine and the Demoniacal Ways 

Those who possess demoniacal constituents and who live unconcerned, without 
following the regulations of scripture, attain lower births and further material 
bondage. But those who possess divine qualities and live regulated lives, abiding 
by scriptural authority, gradually attain spiritual perfection. Stanzas on to three 
list twenty-six enriching constituents as follows: Fearlessness (abhayam); purity 
of heart (sattva-samshuddhi); steadfastness; almsgiving; self-restraint (dama); 
sacrifices (religious rites, Yajnas); right study of the scriptures (svadhyana); 
self-disciple (tapas); straightforwardness (arjavam); non-violence (ahimsa); 
truthfulness (satya); absence of wrath (akrodha); renunciation (Tydga); peace 
(shanty); absence of fault-finding and slander (apaisunam); compassion towards 
all beings (daya); absence of greed (aloluptvam); kindness (mardavam); 
humility (hri); absence of restlessness (achapalam); radiance of character 
(tejas); forgiveness (kshama); cleanliness of body, and purity of mind 
(shaucha); non-hatred (adroha); lack of conceit (na atimanita). These twenty- 
six constituents are all the Supreme 's attributes, and constitute man's spiritual 
heritage. 

Seventeenth Discourse 

The Yoga of the Threefold Faith 

There are three types of faith (Shraddha), corresponding to and evolving from 
the three constituents (modes of material) Nature. Action performed by those 
whose faith is in passion (Rajas) and ignorance (Jamas) yield only 
impermanent, material results, whereas actions performed in goodness (Sattva), 
in accord with scriptural injunctions, purify the heart and lead to pure faith in the 
Supreme Lord Krsna and devotion to Him. The discourse ends most mystically 
with the Brahman. Brahman is divinely designated by the three soul-stirring 
words: 'OM TAT SAT' (17.23). 'OM' ( AUM) is the supreme mystical symbol. 
'OM' is the real Name of the Supreme Being. In the Cosmic manifestation is 
'OM'. Beyond the manifestation, farthest beyond is 'OM'. 'Tat' means 'That', 
the Nameless, Eternal. Above all attributes, majestic 'That' stands. 'Sat' means 
'Reality', the Infinite Truth. We have to chant 'OM' (Aum), and then begin to 
perform our life's detached duties. We have to chant 'Tat' and then offer to 
humanity all our achievements, energising and fulfilling. We have to chant 'Sat' 



26 



and then offer to the Supreme what we inwardly and outwardly are, our very 
existence. 

Eighteenth Discourse 

The Yoga of Liberation by Renunciation 

The Supreme Lord Krsna explains the meaning of renunciation and the effects 
of the constituents (modes) of nature on human consciousness and activity. He 
explains Brahman realization, the glories of the Bhagavad GTta, and the ultimate 
conclusion of the GTta: the highest path of religion is absolute, unconditional 
loving surrender unto the Supreme Lord, which frees one from all sins, brings 
one to complete enlightenment, and enables one to return to Supreme Lord's 
Krsna's eternal spiritual abode. The GTta is the revelation of spirituality. Sooner 
or later all must take to spirituality. There need not and cannot be any 
compulsion. To force others to accept the spiritual life is an act of stupendous 
ignorance. A real teacher (guru) knows that his is not the role of a commander- 
in-chief. He never orders, he simply awakens and illumines the devotees' 
consciousness so that they can grasp the Truth and finally become the Truth. 
Right action is good. Desireless action is extremely good. This dedication is 
called 'tyaga' (the renunciation of attachment to the fruits of all action). The 
Supreme Lord says: For an embodied being it is not possible to abandon actions 
completely; rather it is he who abandons the fruits of actions who deserves the 
name of a renouncer. (18.1 1) When desire is totally rejected and personal gain is 
sincerely not wanted by a devotee, then only perfect freedom shines within and 
without him. 

Something to think about: 

The power of meditation finally, to bring transpersonal awareness as a 'step in' 
is beautifully illustrated by the case of a thirty year-old physicist with whom we 
discussed metaphysics. During meditation he became aware of being in a long 
grey tunnel at the end of which was a bright light. With great joy he realised that 
this light was his life's goal and began running towards it. As he neared the 
light, however, its brilliance began to hurt him and he saw that the light came 
from an intensely illuminated figure of himself which was upside down, 
balanced head-to-head on top of another figure of himself. . . 

The symbol of the illuminated man balanced upside down on the head of his 
normal self is particularly meaningful because it is generally maintained by 
teachers that the upper levels of man's nature have a correspondence in lower 
levels, highest to lowest, etc... and that man's personal and transpersonal 
natures meet at the fourth level, the point of balance. Merging with the illumined 
being consists of folding him down so that his feet come to the ground and the 

27 



resultant figure is a completely integrated man. This is in essence, Sri 
Aurobindo's idea of the necessity in modern times of bringing down the 
transforming power of unconscious (overmind) and the superconscious 
(supermind) so that the embodied soul (man) and his environment both benefit.

Glta Dhyanam 

Meditation on the Glta 

The GTta Dhyanam is a very special song of adoration, which is normally 
chanted at the beginning of a GTta study or simply reading. Through this act of 
worship we open ourselves to the knowledge we are going to receive. If time 
does not permit it is sufficient to chant the last stanza in full concentration, 
intent and with an open heart. 

Om paarthaaya pratibodhitaam bhagavataa naaraayanenaswayam, 
Vyaasena grathitaam puraanamuninaa madhye mahaabhaaratam; 

Advaitaamritavarshineem bhagavateem ashtaadashaa dhyaayineem, 
Amba twaam anusandadhaami bhagavadgeete bhavadweshineem. (1) 

Om, O Bhagavad Glta, with which Partha (Arjuna) was enlightened by the 
Lord Narayana Himself and which was incorporated in the Mahabharata 
by the ancient Muni Vyasa - the Divine Mother, the destroyer of rebirth, 
the instructor of the nectar of Advaita and consisting of eighteen discourses 
- upon You, O Bhagavad Glta! O affectionate Mother! I meditate. (1) 

Namostu te vyaasa vishaalabuddhephullaaravindaayatapatranetra; 

Yena twayaa bhaaratatailapoornah prajwaalito jnaanamayah pradeepah.(2) 

Salutations to You, O Vyasa of profound intellect and with eyes like petals 
of a full-blown lotus, by whom the lamp of knowledge, filled with the oil of 
the Mahabharata, has been lighted. (2) 

Prapannapaarijaataaya totravetraikapaanaye; 
Jnaanamudraaya krishnaaya geetaamritaduhe namah.(3) 

Salutations to Krsna, the Parijata or the Kalpataru (wish-trees), the giver of 
all desires of those who take refuge in Him, the holder of the cane in one 
hand, the holder of Jnanamudra (the symbol of knowledge), the milker of 
the GIta-nectar. (3) 

Sarvopanishado gaavo dogdhaa gopaalanandanah; 

Paartho vatsah sudheer bhoktaa dugdham geetaamritam mahat.(4) 

All the Upanishads are the cows, the milker is Krsna, the cowherd boy, 
Partha (Arjuna) is the calf, men of purified intellect are the drinkers, the 
milk is the supreme nectar of the Glta. (4) 



30 



Vasudevasutam devam kamsachaanooramardanam; 
Devakeeparamaanandam krishnam vande jagadgurum. (5)

attachment be the non-performance of action. (2.47)

Krsna). And, what is Adhibhuta (contingent beings, the physical region)? 
Also, what is called Adhidaiva (the spiritual or divine region)? (8.01)

Eighteenth Discourse 

The Yoga of Liberation by Renunciation 

WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'SANNYASA' AND 'TYAGA' 

arjuna uvaca

You the truth concerning renunciation (sannydsa) as well as of 
abandonment (tyaga), with their difference, O Kesinisudana (O Slayer of 
Kesin, Krsna). (18.01) 

sri-bhagavan uvaca 

kamyanam karmanam nyasam sannyasam kavayo viduh 

sarva-karma-phala-tyagam prahus tyagam vicaksanah (18.02)

The Supreme Lord said: To give up works dictated by desire, Sages know 
this to be renunciation (sannydsa); the abandonment of the fruit of all 
works, say the learned, is tyaga (renunciation, abandonment). (See also 5.01, 
5.05, and 6.01) (18.02) 

tyajyam dosa-vad ity eke karma prahur manisinah 
yajna-dana-tapah-karma na tyajyam iti capare (18.03) 

tyajyam - should be given up; dosa-vat â€” as an evil; iti â€” so; eke â€” some; karma

Arjuna); tri-vidhah â€” of three kinds; samprakirtitah â€” is regarded. 

Hear then My own conclusions as to abandonment (tydga), O best of the 
Bharatas (Arjuna). Indeed, O best of men (O tiger of men, Arjuna), 
abandonment (tydga) is regarded as being threefold. (The word 'sannydsa ' is 
the way it is pronounced, but written 'samnydsa '. Samnydsa and Tydga, are 
synonyms, they both mean abandonment, renunciation, and acts of giving up.) 
(18.04) 

yajna-dana-tapah-karma na tyajyam karyam eva tat 
yajno danam tapas caiva pavanani manisinam (18.05)

The one who gives up an action simply because it causes pain, or because he 
shrinks from bodily distress, commits an act of abandonment that accords

Arjuna, this is the eighteenth discourse entitled, "The Yoga of Liberation 

through Renunciation".

Epilogue 

The Farewell Message of Lord Krsna 

Lord Krsna on the eve of His departure from the arena of this world, after 
finishing the difficult task of establishing Dharma, gave His last parting 
discourse to His uncle Uddhava who was also His dearest devotee and 
follower. 

At the end of a long sermon comprising of more than one thousand verses, 
Uddhava said: O Lord, I think the pursuit of yoga as You narrated to 
Arjuna, and now to me is very difficult, indeed, for most people, because, it 
requires control of the unruly mind and senses. 

Please tell me a short, simple, and easy way to God-Realisation. Lord Krsna 
upon Uddhava's request gave the essentials of self-realisation for the 
modern age as follows: 

(1) Do your duty to the best of your abilities for the Lord without any 
selfish motive, and remember God at all times â€”before starting a work, at 
the completion of a task, and while inactive. 

(2) Practice to look upon all creatures as Myself in thought, word, and deed, 
and mentally bow down to them. 

(3) Perceive that the power of God is with you at all times, through the 
activities of mind, senses, breathing, and emotions; and is constantly doing 
all the work using you as a mere instrument. 

Paramahansa Hariharananda, my Sadguru, says: God is in everything as 
well as above everything. So if you want to realise Him, you must seek Him 
in every atom, in every matter, in every bodily function, and in every 
human being. This is Self-Realisation. 



The essence of God-realisation is also summarised in the four verses of the 
Bhagavata Purana (BP 2.09.32-35) as hereunder: 

The Supreme Lord Krsna said: All of Me, namely My actual eternal form 
and My transcendental existence, colour, qualities and activities â€”let all be 
awakened within you by factual realisation, out of My causeless mercy. (32) 



275 



Brahma, it is I, the Personality of Godhead, who existed before the creation, 
when there was nothing but Myself. Nor was there the material nature, the 
cause of this creation. That which you see now is also I, the Personality of 
Godhead, and after annihilation what remains will also be I, the Personality 
of Godhead. (33) 

O Brahma, whatever appears to be of any value, if it is without relation to 
Me, has no reality. Know it as My illusory energy, that reflection which 
appears to be in darkness. (34) 

O Brahma, please know that the universal elements enter into the cosmos 
and at the same time do not enter into the cosmos; similarly, I Myself also 
exist within everything created, and at the same time I am outside of 
everything. (35) 

Uddhava took up his mission. He accepted the dharma given to him by his 
guru, Krsna, and attained the experience of Oneness. But what of the 
Supreme Lord Krsna, the complete avatar, the teacher and friend of all, the 
Radiant One? In the Bhagavatha Purana, Sage Shuka describes what 
happens next. Knowing that Dvaraka will be destroyed, the Supreme Lord 
Krsna sends the women, children and older men to safety in Sankhoddra. 
The younger men asked to go to Prabhasa to purify themselves. But the 
cleansing is of no avail and the destiny of the Yadus is fulfilled when they 
attack the Lord Krsna, and he and Balarama finally destroy them. After 
this battle, while He rests beside a tree, the Lord Krsna is pierced in the 
foot by the arrow of a hunter. This too is as it has been foretold, and, in a 
final moment of meditation, the Lord Krsna leaves the earthly plane. 

Did the Supreme Lord Krsna die? The verses of the Bhagavatha Purana 
that relate to this question are compelling and mysterious: 

With Brahma, the celestial sages and the gods before him, 
All of whom he knew were none other than himself, 
The Radiant One, Krsna, closed his lotus eyes, 
And withdrew himself into the Self 

By practising the Yogic method of Agni dharana, 

He burnt the body which had delighted all who knew it 

And which, when meditated on, 

Grants grace to the devotee. 

Then He entered His own realm. 

(Book 2, 31: 5-6) 

The word that is mysterious here is dagdhva. Some translators have read 
the text as i adagdhva\ 'without burning', and others, like Swami 



276 



Venkatesananda, have read it as i dagdhva\ 'with burning'. A final clue in 
verse 13 of the same discourse: 

The Radiant One, Shri Krsna, 

Had the power to create, sustain and destroy 

All of creation. 

Yet He did not wish 

To preserve His body here any longer 

Even though he could. 

For he had always taught that the perishable 

Is not worth saving. 

Did the body of the Supreme Lord Krsna die? That is for each devotee to 
decide for him or herself, the sacred writings leave enough ambiguity for us 
to answer in the way that each find most acceptable. Maybe, the Supreme 
Lord Krsna dies every time we do not let him live through our lives in a 
manner He prescribed in the Bhagavad GIta. Perhaps the Supreme Lord 
Krsna lives in us when we open our hearts and minds to His teaching, 
purifying ourselves in the ways He taught - through love and compassion to 
all beings, exercised in the spirit of renunciation.

Glta Mahatmyam 

The Greatness of the Glta 

The GTtd Mahatmyam is a tribute to the Bhagavad Glta which is normally 
recited at the close of a GTtd reading or chanting. When time does not permit, it 
is sufficient to read or chant only verses 21 and 22. Remember the GTtd contains 
the cream of the Vedas and Upanishads. For this reason it is a universal 
scripture suited for people of all temperaments and for all ages, and of all 
religions.

Sri ganesaya namah 

r 

Sri radharamanaya (Krsna) namah 

Adoration to Sri Ganesa 

Adoration to Sri Radharamana (Krsna) 

Sri Ganesa is the personification of the cosmic functioning of Iswara 
(Supreme Being, God, Ruler of the Cosmos). He embodies wisdom and he 
removes obstacles. He is therefore, also here, invoked at the beginning of all 
auspicious undertakings. Radharamana is the appellation attributed to the 
Supreme Lord Krsna because of His being the Idol of worship during His 
boyhood by the Gopi, Sreemati Radha. 

Dharovaacha: Bhagavan parameshaana bhaktiravyabhichaarinee; 
Praarabdham bhujyamaanasya katham bhavati he prabho.(l) 

Dhara (the Earth) said: O Blessed Lord, O Ruler Supreme, O Adorable 
One, how may he, who is bound by his 'Prarabdha karma' gain constant 
devotion? (1) 

Sri Vishnuruvaacha: Praarabdham bhujyamaano hi geetaabhyaasaratah 

sadaa; 

Sa muktah sa sukhee loke karmanaa nopalipyate.(2) 

The Lord Vishnu said: Even he who is dominated by 'Prarabdha karma' 
can be a Mukta (one who becomes free from the cycles of birth and death) and 
a happy man in this world if he be devoted to the constant practice of the 
Glta. No new karma ever taints him. (2) 

Mahaapaapaadipaapaani geetaadhyaanam karoti chet; 
Kwachit sparsham na kurvanti nalineedalam ambuvat.(3) 



278 



No sin, however heinous can ever affect him who meditates on the GIta, any 
more than water affects the lotus leaf. (3) 

Geetaayaah pustakam yatra yatra paathah pravartate; 
Tatra sarvaani teerthaani prayaagaadeeni tatra vai. 
Sarve devaashcha rishayo yoginahpannagaashcha ye; 
Gopaalaa gopikaa vaapi naaradoddhava paarshadaih.(4-5) 

Where the book Bhagavad GIta is kept, where the study of it is conducted, 
there are present all the sacred places, there verily are the Prayagas and 
such sanctums. The Devas, the Rishis, the yogins, the Pannagas, the 
Gopalas, the Gopis, Narada, Uddhava and the whole hosts of their 
comrades are all present there. (4-5) 

Sahaayo jaayate sheeghram yatra geetaa pravartate; 
Yatra geetaavichaarashcha pathanam paathanam shrutam; 
Tatraaham nishchitam prithvi nivasaami sadaiva hi.(6) 

Where the GIta is read, there help comes quickly; where the GIta is 
inquired into, chanted, taught, or listened to, O Earth, there undoubtedly 
and unfailingly do I Myself reside. (6) 

Geetaashraye'ham tishthaami geetaa me chottamam griham; 
Geetaajnaanam upaashritya treen Uokaan paalayaamyaham.(7) 

I abide in the refuge of the GIta; the GIta is My foremost residence. I 
protect the three worlds based on wisdom of the GIta. (7) 

Geetaa me paramaa vidyaa brahmaroopaa na samshayah; 
Ardhamaatraaksharaa nityaa swaanirvaachyapadaatmikaa. 
Chidaanandena krishnena proktaa swamukhato'rjuna; 
Vedatrayee paraanandaa tatwaarthajnaanasamyutaa. (8-9) 

The GIta is My Knowledge Supreme; it is undoubtedly the embodiment of 
Brahman; this Knowledge is absolute; it is imperishable, eternal, of the 
essence of My indefinable State; it comprises all the three Vedas; it is all 
blissful; it consists of the realisation of the true nature of the Self; it is 
declared by the Omniscient and Blessed Krsna Himself to Arjuna. (8-9) 

Yoashtaadashajapen nityam naro nishchalamaanasah; 
Jnaanasiddhim sa labhate tato yaatiparam padam.(lO) 



279 



That man who recites the eighteen chapters daily with a form mind, gains 
perfection in knowledge and thereby reaches the supreme state. (10) 

Paathe'asamarthah sampoornam tato'rdham paathamaacharet; 
Tadaa godaanajam puny am labhate naatra samshayah.(ll) 

If the whole of it cannot be recited, half of it may be recited; through that 
act the aspirant acquires merit on a par with the gift of a cow. There is no 
doubt about it. (11) 

Tribhaagam pathamaanastu gangaasnaanaphalam labhet; 
Shadamsham japamaanastu somayaagaphalam labhet.(12) 

He who recites a third part acquires the merit obtained by bathing in the 
Ganges. He who recites a sixth part gets the fruit of the Soma -sacrifice 

(Soma, name of an invigorating vine). (12) 

Ekaadhyaayam tu yo nityam pathate bhaktisamyutah; 
Rudralokam avaapnoti gano bhootwaa vasecchiram (13) 

He who reads even a chapter a day with devotion gains the Rudraloka and 
lives there long having become an attendant (or, a Gana: an attendant of the 
Lord Shiva) on Siva. (13) 

Adhyaayam shlokapaadam vaa nityam yah pathate narah; 
Sa yaati narataam yaavanmanwantaram vasundhare.(14) 

O Earth, he who reads a quarter of a chapter, or of a stanza daily, attains to 
human birth throughout the duration of a Manu (or, Manvantara:71 
Mahayugas or 308,448,000 years). (14) 

Geetaayaah shloka dashakam sapta pancha chatushtayam; 

Dwautreenekam tadardhamvaa shlokaanaam yah pathennarah. 
Chandralokam avaapnoti varshaanaam ayutam dhruvam; 

Geetaapaathasamaayukto mrito maanushataam vrajet. (15-16) 

The man who recites ten, seven, five, four, three or two stanzas, or even one 
or half a stanza of the GIta, certainly lives in Chandraloka for ten thousand 
years. He, who leaves the body while reading the GIta, obtains the region of 
man. (15-16) 

Geetaabhyaasam punah kritwaa labhate muktim uttamaam; 
Geetetyucchaarasamyukto mriyamaano gatim labhet.(17) 



280 



Again, practising the GIta, man attains supreme Mukti (liberation from 
material existence). The dying man uttering the word "GIta" will attain the 
goal. (17) 

Geetaarthashravanaasakto mahaapaapayuto'pi vaa; 
Vaikuntham samavaapnoti vishnunaa saha modate.(18) 

Even he who has committed heinous sins goes to Vaikuntha (Vishnu's 
heaven) and lives in communion with Vishnu if he loves to hear the meaning 
of the GIta. (18) 

Geetaartham dhyaayate nityam kritwaa karmaani bhoorishah; 
Jeevanmuktah sa vijneyo dehaante paramam padam.(19) 

He is to be regarded a Jivanmukta (liberated embodied soul, a devotee; in 
other words: A Jivanmukta is one who has attained liberation while living) who 
constantly meditates on the meaning of the Gita in the midst of performing 
his karma without respite. He attains the supreme state at the fall of his 
body. (19) 

Geetaam aashritya bahavo bhoobhujo janakaadayah; 
Nirdhootakalmashaa loke geetaa yaataah param padam.(20) 

Many kings like Janaka became free from evils and attained the highest 
state by following this GIta. So is it related. (20) 

Geetaayaah pathanam kritwaa maahaatmyam naiva yah pathet; 
Vrithaa paatho bhavet tasya shrama eva hyudaahritah. (21) 

His reading is in vain and his effort is wasted who does not read this 
'Mahatmyam' after having completed the reading of the GIta. (21) 

(This verse has only to be understood as a test, a confirmation as it were of faith 
(shraddha) in the Bhagavad GTtd, which is not only a literary or philosophical 
book of high moral value, but it is also the word of God as many other sacred 
scriptures in the world, and should therefore be studied with great faith and 
devotion. While reading the Bhagavad GTtd, one is really entering the Supreme 
Presence of God, as in meditation. Be very silent, very silent, and hear the still 
small voice within you, the voice that brings you inner peace. The 'GTtd 
Mahatmya ' generates this devotion in one 's heart.) 



281 



Etanmaahaatmyasamyuktam geetaabhyaasam karoti yah; 
Sa tatphalamavaapnoti durlabhaam gatim aapnuyaat.(22) 

He who studies the GIta together with this discourse on its Mahatmyam gets 
the fruit stated herein, and reaches that goal which is rare to attain. (22) 

Suta Uvaacha: Maahaatmyam etad geetaayaah mayaa proktam sanaatanam; 
Geetaante cha pathedyastu yaduktam tatphalam labhet.(23) 

Suta said: He who reads this eternal greatness of the GIta, declared by me, 
after reading the GIta, will obtain the reward described herein. (23) 

Iti sri varaha purana srigita mahatmyam sampurnam 
Thus concludes in the Varaha Purana the discourse designated. 

AUM, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti

FORTY VERSES of the GITA 

(Shri Gita Chalisa For Daily Reading) 

I offer my obeisance to Lord Krsna, the world 

teacher, who is the son of Vasudeva, the remover 

of all obstacles, the supreme bliss of His mother 

Devaki, and whose grace makes the 

dumb eloquent and the cripple 

cross the mountains. 



Dhrtarastra said: O Sanjaya, what did the sons of Pandu and mine do when they 
gathered on the sacred plain of Kuruksetra, eager for battle? (1.01) 

Sanjaya said: To him who was in this way overwhelmed with compassion and 
affliction, whose eyes were distraught and filled with tears, Madhava (Krsna, the 
destroyer ofMadhu), spoke these words: (2:1) 

The Supreme Lord said: You mourn for those who deserve no grief, and yet you 
speak words of wisdom. For the living or the dead wise men know no grief. 
(2.11) 

Just as in this bodily form the Self (Soul) experiences childhood, youth and old 
age, so does it pass into another body (after death). In this a thoughtful man has 
no doubts. (See also 15.08) (2.13) 

Just as a man casts off his worn-out clothes, and puts on other new ones, so the 
embodied (Soul, Self) casts off his worn-out bodies and enters others, new ones. 

(2.22) 

Take as equal pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat; prepare 
yourself for battle (your duty). In so doing you will bring no evil to yourself. 

(2.38) 

Your concern is with the respective action alone; its fruits are never within your 
control. So, let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be 
the non-performance of action. (2.47) 



283 



He, who is fixed in wisdom, discards both good and evil works. Therefore, take 
refuge in yoga (spiritual discipline on the way of oneness with the Supreme 
Being). Yoga is skill in action. (2.50) 

Hither and thither the senses rove, and when the mind is attuned to them, sweeps 
away his knowledge, just as the wind carries away a ship upon the waters. (2.67) 

All actions are done by the constituents of nature (prakrti). He, whose mind is 
fooled by the ego, thinks T am the doer'. (See also 5.09, 13.29, and 14.19) 

(3.27) 

Know "Him" (Atmd, the Self) who is beyond the intellect, subduing the self 
(one's own mind) by the Self. O mighty-armed (Arjuna), destroy the enemy 
swift to change in the form of lust, hard to conquer. (3.43) 
Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (righteousness) and Adharma 
(unrighteousness) grows powerfully, then, O Bharata (Arjuna), I manifest 
Myself. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the evildoers, for 
the establishment of righteousness, I am born from age to age. (See also Tr 
1.120.03-04) (4.07-08) 

He who can see inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is wise among men, 
integrated (yukta), he is the performer of all action. (See also 3.05; 3.27; 5.08 
and 13.29) (4.18) 

The offering is Brahman; Brahman is the clarified butter, offered by Brahman in 
Brahman's fire. He who fixes his mind (samddhi) on Brahman, indwelt by 
Brahman, to Brahman he must go. (Also see 9.16) (4.24) 

Nothing on earth is as purifying as knowledge. He who is perfected by Yoga 
finds this in time of his own accord in himself and by himself. (See also 4.31, 
5.06, and 18.78) (4.38) 

Hard to attain is renunciation, O mighty-armed (Arjuna) without the practise of 
Yoga. A sage well-versed and integrated in Yogic exercise (yoga-yukta) soon 
reaches Brahman. (See also 4.31, 4.38 and 5.08) (5.06) 

He who acts, offering all actions to Brahman (the Supreme, the Self-existent), 
abandoning attachment, is not affected by sin, as a lotus pedal by water. (5.10) 

He, who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me, for him I am not lost, 
nor is he lost for Me. (6.30) 



284 



Fourfold are the virtuous people who worship Me, O Arjuna, the afflicted, the 
ones who look for knowledge, the ones who strive for gain (self-interested), and 
the men of knowledge (the learned, the wise), O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna). 
(See also TR 1.21.03) (7.16) 

At the close of many births, the man of knowledge takes refuge in Me, 
concluding that Vasudeva's son (Krsna) is all. Such a noble soul (Mahatma) is 
very rare. (7.19) 

The foolish ones think I am the Unmanifested, as having manifestation, knowing 
not My supreme nature, immutable and superior. (7.24) 

On whatever form (bhdva) a man thinks about at the time of passing, that alone 
does he accede, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because he has ever been engaged in 
the thought thereof. (8.06) (See also ChU 3. 14.01) (8.06) 

Therefore, at all times only remember Me and fight. With mind and intellect 
fixed on Me, you will without doubt come to Me. (8.07) 

Who bears Me in mind unceasingly, thinking of nothing else at all, to him I am 
easily attainable, O Partha (Arjuna), of this ever integrated yogi. (8.14) 

To those who meditate on Me alone, thinking of no other, worshipping Me, ever 
perseveringly, I provide gain and security. (9.22) 

Whoever with devotion (bhakti) gives Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water, that do 
I accept, from the self-conquered, for it was devotion that made the offering. 
(See also BP 10.81.04) (9.26) 

On Me fix your mind; be devoted to Me; sacrifice to Me; prostrate to Me. 
Having made yourself integrated in Me, taking Me as the Supreme Goal, you 
shall certainly come to Me. (9.34) 

I am the origin of all; all things evolve from Me: this knowing, the wise 
commune perseveringly with (bha-j) Me. (See also RV 8.58.02) (10.08) 

Perform actions for Me, and make Me your highest goal, be loyal in love 
(bhakta) to me, be unattached, have no hatred for any being at all: for all who do 
so come to Me, O Pandava (Arjuna). (See also 8.22) (11.55) 

Fix your mind on Me only, and let your intellect dwell within Me; then in very 
truth (eva) you will abide hereafter in Me alone. (12.08)

He who sees the Supreme Lord abiding ever the same in all contingent beings, 
immortal in the mortal, he indeed sees. (13.27) 

And, as to him who do Me honour with unswerving Yoga of devotion, passes 
beyond the constituents (Gunas), fit for becoming Brahman. (See also 7.14 and 
15.19) (14.26) 

I make My dwelling in the hearts of all: from Me are memory and knowledge, as 
well as their non-attendance. It is I who am to be known by means of all the 
Vedas. I am the maker of the Vedanta, and also the knower of the Vedas. (See 
also 6.39) (15.15) 

Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self: lust, anger, and greed. 
Therefore, avoid these three. (See also MB 5.33.66) (16.21) 

Words that do not cause offence, that are truthful, pleasant and beneficial, and 
also the practice of sacred recitation, are termed the penance of the tongue (or, 
the word). (17.15) 

By supreme devotion (meaning, love and loyalty) he realises Me as I really am, 
who and what I am. Then, knowing Me in truth, he immediately enters into the 
Supreme (he enters into 'That'). (See also 5.19) (18.55) 

The Lord dwells in the region of the heart of all contingent beings, O Arjuna, 
and by His illusive power (Maya) making them all whirl as if fixed in a 
machine. (18.61) 

Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), turn to Me, your only refuge, for I will 
deliver you of all evils. Do not grieve. (18.66) 

But whoever shall impart to My loving devotees this supreme secret knowledge, 
showing the highest devotion (bhakti: love and loyalty) to Me, will come and 
reach Me without doubt. (18.68) 

Whenever Krsna, the Lord of Yoga is; wherever is Partha (Arjuna) the Archer, 
there is prosperity, victory, happiness, and firm morality. (18.78) 

Harih AUM tatsat Harih AUM tatsat Harih AUM tatsat 

Sri Krsnarpanam astu subham bhuyat. 

AUM Santih Santih Santih 

This is offered to Lord Sri Krsna. 
May He bless us all with

Goodness, prosperity, and peace.

Chanting the Bhagavad Glta 



The traditional melody of the Sanskrit stanzas 



Recite the stanzas along the under mentioned melodies, while trying to keep the 
rhythmic cadence free, and chant meditatively, which means: Sing slowly as it 
were pondering on every word you pronounce. Most of the stanzas are sung as 
shown in the following example: Discourse 1:1. Other stanzas are sung 
following the example of Discourse 2:5. The change of tune is recognised by an 
asterisk for the phonetic sound. Before starting with the first chapter, let us try

Selected Study Topics for Satsang Meetings 

Foreword 

Scriptures are indispensable to all religions. They save religions from mutation 
and from sure extinction; The personal faith which has no good news (gospel) 
for its guidance gets lost in a series of transformations, as far as to disintegrate 
and loose its individuality. However, a personal faith that draws sanction and 
inspiration from a sacred book is able to keep its own. It has in such a sacred 
document authoritative statements to encounter the opposition and meet the 
attacks of the heretical. All the religions of the world that have endured the 
ravages of time and of transformation have their own scriptures for anchorage. 
That the Bible is the scripture of Christianity is a well-known fact. The Qur'an 
remains ever associated with the Islamic religion. The scripture of the Buddhist 
is the sacred collection of all the enlightened utterances of Buddha Gautama, 
known as the Dammapada. The followers of all other important religions, as the 
Baha'i Faith, may also be said to be more familiar with their sacred books. 
However, the case of the Hindu is different. Among the followers of the 
different "paths", he alone is bewildered in regard to this problematic question. 
He may not know which book can be termed his scripture. If a mention is made 
of the Vedas, he may confess never having had the occasion to see or handle 
these books, let alone the question of getting acquainted with their contents. 
Many a Hindu may mention with some hesitance this or that sacred book from 
which he draws inspiration and guidance. The popular conviction is that the 
Vedas are the direct or indirect sources of all the sacred books in relation to 
Hinduism. However, the cream of the Vedas is the Upanishads, and these have 
been carefully guarded both against extinction and mutilation. All the systems of 
philosophy in India derive their inspiration and authority from these Upanishads. 
They are called the "Forest Books" because of the environment in which they 
became revealed to the Sages, popularly known as "Rishis". A synopsis and 
classification of the contents of the Upanishads goes by the name of the 
"Brahma Sutras" or the Vedanta Sutras. The Bhagavad-Gita as third book is 
different. It is the essence of the Upanishads, not in the sense that it is all 
condensed into terse form, but in the sense that the Vedanta Philosophy is made 
easy of understanding. One who has studied and meditated on the Bhagavad- 
Gita may be said to have caught the main teachings of the Upanishads. These 
three books we mentioned, namely the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the 
Bhagavad-Gita are called the "Scriptural Trinity" (Prasthanatrayain). They 
constitute the final authority on Hindu scriptural matters, open to the whole 
world. 



290 



The age which existed before this current age (the Kaliyuga) was one in which 
the mind of man did not suffer from the moral weakness and lack of control 
which is even today prevalent. According to Indian tradition the "Kaliyuga" 
began on a date equivalent to midnight between the 17th and 18th of February 
3102 years BC. It is the fourth and lowest age of a series in which the physical 
and moral decline of man reaches its lowest. This means that the age prior to this 
current one may have had conditions in which the "Art of Devotion to Self 
Knowledge" was not so difficult. So it seems that around 5100 years ago there 
were wise people who had a degree of care for all of us today and the ages to 
come, with the difficult task to control the mind and the desires in life. 

It is most likely that in the previous age wisdom was only handed on by word of 
mouth. The Vedas and Upanishads were used in those times as guides to those 
who were seekers of union with the True and Higher Self, which lives in the 
hearts of all. Indian tradition states that the Vedas and Upanishads were written 
down at a time when this became a requirement for their preservation, (i.e. when 
the mind of man was unable to be sure to remember them truly.) 

The Supreme Lord Krishna came during those ancient and difficult times and 
gave his most blessed teaching to his beloved disciples Arjuna and Uddhava. 
These were later written and formed part of a greater body of Vedic Scripture 
and legend. The Bhagavad-Gita {to Arjuna) and the Uddhava Gita {to Uddhava) 
contain the systematic approach to self-development which the Supreme Lord 
Krishna recommended. 

How to conduct a "Satsang" gathering 

The following system intends to conduct a Gita Meditation Group: 

â€¢ Sit in a quiet, comfortable place with a beautifully decorated altar with 
pictures of the Supreme Lord Krishna, and a Bhagavad-Gita. 

â€¢ A lamp is lighted by one of the participants, incense sticks may be lighted, 
and some prasad kept at the altar offered by the participants for 
distribution later on. The Lord 

Whoever with devotion {bhakti) gives Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, 
water, that do I accept, from the self-conquered, for it was devotion 
that made the offering. (See also BP 10.81.04) (9.26) 



â€¢ 



The moderator or guest speaker begins the session by leading the chanting 
of OM three times. We are always singing the Gayatri Mantra three times. 
This is followed by prayers and few bhajans. This is for about 15 minutes. 



291 



Then few shlokas of Gita are chanted or recited together, or just listened 
to. 

â€¢ Then the moderator or guest speaker begins by introducing the topic or 
summarising what was heard and discussed last time. Thereafter begins 
the study of a portion of the Bhagavad-Gita. Everyone sits quietly and 
attentively listening to the talk and are taking down notes - wherever 
necessary. This is for only about 30 minutes or as what the moderator 
deems fit. 

â€¢ The moderator or guest speaker then invites, invokes and encourages 
everyone to open up and share his or her reactions and views on the talk 
just heard. Thereafter the moderator concludes the discussion. 

â€¢ After the discussion everyone sits down with their eyes closed for 
meditation for around 15-20 minutes. 

â€¢ At the close Prasad is distributed in complete silence and respect. 

â€¢ Everyone leaves quietly the meditation room. 

General Historical Introduction 

The Bhagavad-Gita is part of the Mahabharata, the epic poem of India relating 
the struggles between the Kuru and Pandu dynasties descended from King 
Bharata. The Gita starts with a battle about to occur over the possession of a 
few villages. One of the heroes of the Pandu faction, Arjuna, looks at his 
relatives and friends on the opposing side and decides that even though he is 
certain of victory, he has no desire for bloodshed. He denounces war as leading 
to the destruction of families and to lawlessness, adding that only those whose 
wits are blinded by greed would not experience guilt in destroying a family line 
or betraying friends. Attributed to Vyasa, "the arranger", the Bhagavad Gita 
was probably compiled by a number of writers sometime between 500 and 200 
BCE. 

The introductory section of the Bhagavad-Gita, portraying Arjuna 's 
compassionate human feelings, is followed by the elaboration of a Hindu 
theology that includes a justification for warfare and slaughter, put forward by 
Lord Krishna (the incarnation of the universal Hindu God, Vishnu). Krishna's 
argument relies on beliefs concerning transmigration of personal identity into 
other bodies (reincarnation), rejection of worldly desires, achievement of 
egoless tranquillity of mind, exercises in yoga, and adherence to a strict caste 
system. From these tenets, Krishna argues that people should not be concerned 
with the results of deeds but merely with ensuring that the deeds are done 
properly. 



292 



In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna contends, first, that every class of person has a 
code of social-religious work incumbent upon it (a caste); and, second, a 
person's religious duty is to bring one's soul into unity with the Supreme Self (of 
which Krishna is a manifestation). Enlightenment can be reached by casting off 
social ties and dwelling alone in meditation, or by performing all the social and 
religious duties of one's assigned caste, without regard to results. Krishna 
recommends the second way as appropriate for Arjuna. His caste-duty is to be a 
fighting man; he ought to kill people without remorse. 

Dhritarashtra is the blind king of the Kurus; his charioteer, Sanjava, reports the 
progress of the battle to him. Arjuna, a warrior in the opposing Pandu army has 
Krishna as his charioteer. In the original text, the participants are given a 
variety of honorific names. For clarity, these have been replaced by the given 
names, except where they help in delineating character. Most of Krishna's 
extensive theological argument that follows the battle is omitted. 
But short extracts are given to indicate the main points of the argument and to 
give the flavour of the rhetoric employed to convince Arunja. Krishna is takes 
pains to show that his pronouncements are authoritative. 

The Bhagavad-Gita is a theological work of eighteen Lessons that represented a 
new synthesis of the elements of ancient Hindu Vedic religion, turning it into a 
new theism. The warrior god Krishna comes to the fore, transformed to take the 
place of all previous gods, requiring the devout to come with loving faith to him 
alone. Furthermore, it is a more democratic religion than the previous 
Brahmanism: even those of low birth â€” women, traders, and labourers â€” are 
offered hope of reaching the supreme path. In addition, "action " is no longer to 
be avoided as inevitably leading to bondage. Instead it is made clear that action 
free from desire, carried out without selfish ends in view, can set a person free. 
The end section contains the description Krishna gives of the moral qualities 
that distinguish good and evil. 

Selected Study Topics along the eighteen chapters of the 
Bhagavad-Gita 

1 Preparations for Battle 

Dhrtarastra said: 

O Sanjaya, what did the sons of Pandu and mine do when they gathered on the 

sacred plain of Kuruksetra, eager for battle? (1.01) 

Sanjaya said: Having seen the army of the Pandavas ranged for battle, Prince 
Duryodhana went up to his acarya (teacher), Drona, and said: (1.02) 



293 



Look, O Teacher, at this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, which has been 
positioned by your talented pupil, the son of Drupada. (1.03) 
There are in it heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhlma and Arjuna: 
Yuyudhana, Virata, and the great warrior (mahdratha) Drupada, (1.04) 

Yourself and Bhlsma, Kama, the victorious Krpa, Asvatthama and Vikarna, also 

Jayadratta, the son of Somadatta; (1.08) 

And, many other heroes giving up their lives for me, fighting with various 

weapons, and all well skilled in the art of warfare. (1.09) 

This army of ours, commanded by Bhlsma is unbeatable, whereas that army of 

theirs which is under the protection of Bhlma is inadequate. (1.10) 

Sanjaya said: In response to Gudakesa's (Arjuna) request, O Bharata 

(Dhrtardshtra), Hrslkesa stationed that finest among chariots between the two 

armies. (1.24) 

Confronting Bhlsma and Drona and all the rulers of earth, he said: O Partha 

(Arjuna), look at these assembled Kurus. (1.25) 

Then, the son of Partha (Arjuna) saw ranged there in both the armies fathers 

(paternal uncles), grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, 

grandsons and comrades, father-in-laws and friends. (1.26) 

When the son of Kunti (Arjuna) saw that all those standing there in the ranks of 

the two armies were his kinsmen, he was overwhelmed with deepest pity and 

consequently said in sorrow: (l:27-28a) 

When the son of Kunti (Arjuna) saw that all those standing there in the ranks of 

the two armies were his kinsmen, he was overwhelmed with deepest pity and 

consequently said in sorrow: (l:27-28a) 

Arjuna said: Seeing these kinsmen, O Krsna, ranged, eager for combat, my 

limbs fail, and my mouth is dried up, my body quivers and my hair stands on 

end. (1.28b-29) 

The GandTva (bow) slips from my hand, and my skin is terribly burning. I am 

not able to stand, and my mind is spiralling as it were. (1.30) 

I see opposing omens, O Kesava (Krsna), and do not see any good from killing 

my kinsmen in battle. (1.31) 

I do not wish victory, O Krsna, nor kingdoms or pleasures. What is the use to us 

in having a kingdom, O Govinda (Krsna), or amusement and even life. (1.32) 

Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures stand here 

for battle, having abandoned life and wealth; (1.33) 

Teachers, fathers (paternal uncles), sons and grandfathers, maternal uncles, 

fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and also (other) relatives. (1.34) 



294 



Chapter one introduces the scene, the setting, the circumstances and the 
characters involved determining the reasons for the Bhagavad-Gita's 
revelation. The scene is the sacred plain of Kuruksetra. The setting is a 
battlefield. The circumstances is war. The main characters are the 
Supreme Lord Krishna and Prince Arjuna, witnessed by four million 
soldiers led by their respective military commanders. After naming the 
principal warriors on both sides, Arjuna 's growing dejection is described 
due to the fear of losing friends and relatives in the course of the 
impending war and the subsequent sins attached to such actions. As the 
opposing armies stand poised for battle, Arjuna, the mighty warrior, sees 
his intimate relatives, teachers and friends in both armies ready to fight 
and sacrifice their lives. Overcome by grief and pity, Arjuna fails in 
strength, his mind becomes bewildered, and he gives up his determination 
to fight. So, this chapter is entitled: Lamenting the Consequence of War. 
The conflict between the contending cousin-groups was too sharp to be 
squared up; One stood for righteousness and possessed legitimate claim 
to the kingdom; the other was out to usurp it, the rights of the rival, by 
foul means. In this, war became inevitable. 



2 Arjuna's Remorse in Combat 

Arjuna said: O Madhava (Krsna), how shall I attack with arrows in combat 

Bhlsma and Drona, for they are worthy of respect, O Arisudana (O slayer of 

foes, Krsna)? (2.04) 

For better were it here in this world to eat a beggar's food rather than by killing 

these teachers of high honour. However, were I to kill them, I should only enjoy 

wealth and worldly pleasures tainted with blood. (2.05) 

We do not know which is the better alternative for us, to conquer them or they 

conquer us. There facing us stand Dhrtarustra's sons, whom having killed, we 

should not even care to live. (2:06) 

My very being (svathdva) is stained by the harmful taint of feeble pity, and my 

mind confounded about right and wrong (Dharma, Brahman who supports all). I 

ask you; tell me what is absolutely good. I am Your disciple, having surrounded 

myself to You, teach me for all my trust is in You. (2.07) 

I see no means to dispel the sorrow which parches my senses, even after 

attaining unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth or even lordship over the 

gods themselves. (2:08) 

Sanjaya said: Having spoken like this to Hrsikesa (Krsna), the powerful 

Gudakesa, scorcher of the foe (Arjuna), fall silent, saying to Govinda (Krsna): T 

will not fight' and he held his peace. (2.09) 

To him who was grieving, sitting amidst of the two armies, O Bharata (Arjuna), 

Hrsikesa (Krsna) smiling as it were, spoke these words: (2.10) 



295 



The Supreme Lord said: You mourn for those who deserve no grief, and yet you 

speak words of wisdom. For the living or the dead wise men know no grief. 

(2.11) 

Never did I not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of men ; nor will there be a time 

in the future when we shall cease to exist. (2.12) 

Just as in this bodily form the Self (Soul) experiences childhood, youth and old 

age, so does it pass into another body (after death). In this, a thoughtful man has 

no doubts. (See also 15.08) (2.13) 

The sense-contacts, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), which give rise to heat and cold, 

pleasure and pain, come and go, they are impermanent. Learn to endure them, O 

Bharata (Arjuna). (2.14) 

It is the wise man who is not afflicted by them, who remains undaunted in pain 

and pleasure, who becomes fit to attain immortality, O chief among men 

(Arjuna). (2.15) 

Arjuna submits himself to the Supreme Lord Krishna as one of His 
disciple, and the Supreme Lord begins His teachings to Arjuna by 
explaining the fundamental distinction between the temporary material 
body and the eternal spiritual soul. The Lord explains the process of 
transmigration, the nature of selfless service to the Supreme and the 
characteristics of a self-realized person. The man who fails to face a 
crisis, speaking and acting irrelevantly, is denounced as a dolt. However, 
Arjuna is not made of that inferior stuff, as the training he received was 
superb. He is literally a vanquisher of foes. The manifest world is 
comprised of two categories - Purusha and Prakriti (we will later see), 
the noumenon and the phenomenon; one becoming manly and courageous 
to the extent one identifies oneself with the noumenon. This identification 
is 'Atmabodham' '(strength). Weakness is condemned downright by the 
Supreme Lord. Atman cannot be attained by the weak, is found in the 
Upanishads. The message of the Supreme Lord Krishna is based on this 
fundamental principle. To be firm of body, with a great mind, constant of 
character, excellences like that are all born of strength. This world and 
the next too are for the strong alone. Right conduct originates from 
strength and straightforwardness, while the practice of yoga (meditation) 
is possible because of it. In the strength of the Supreme Lord lies the key 
and the clue to all the teachings of the Supreme Lord. Exalted life starts 
with "Atmabodham " which expresses itself as strength; Strength is life, 
while weakness is death. 



296 



3 Which is better knowledge or action 

Arjuna said: O Janardana (Krsna), if you think that knowledge is superior to 

action, why then, O Kesava (Krsna), do you command me to carry out a terrible 

action? (3.01) 

With these perplexing words, You confuse as it were my mind. Tell me with 

certainty the one way by which I may attain bliss. (3.02) 

The Supreme Lord said: O sinless one (Arjuna), as it has been stated by Me 

before, in this world there is a twofold path, that of knowledge (Jhana-yoga) for 

those who contemplate and that of action (Karma-yoga) for those who act. 

(3.03) 

Not by leaving action undone does man win freedom from the bond of action, 

nor by renunciation alone does he attain perfection. (3.04) 

Not for a moment can a man remain without acting; for every man is helpless, 

and forced to work by the impulses born of nature. (3.05) 

The deluded who controls his limbs through which he acts, but sits thinking in 

his mind about sense-objects, is said to be a hypocrite. (3.06) 

But he who controls his senses with his mind, O Arjuna, using the organs of 

action without attachment, is worthily engaged in Karma-yoga. (3.07) 

Perform the action that is prescribed for you, for action is superior to inaction. 

And even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for you by 

inaction. (3.08) 

On the strength of our identification with Arjuna 's heart, we are apt to 
feel, at the beginning of the third chapter, that we are thrown into the 
world of ruthless confusion and immense doubt. Arjuna wants immediate 
relief from his mental tension; he wants to hear a decisive truth. His 
impatience prevent him from seeing the total truth in all its aspects. In the 
preceding chapter, his Supreme Teacher, Sri Krishna, expressed his deep 
appreciation for the Path of Knowledge, but at the same time told Arjuna 
of the great necessity of action. The Teacher, needless to say, had not the 
slightest intention of throwing the disciple (devotee) into the sea of 
confusion. Far from it. What Arjuna required was a broader vision of 
truth and a deeper meaning of Reality. When we see through the eyes of 
Arjuna we see that his world is a world of conflicting ideas. But when we 
see through the eyes o Sri Krishna, we see a world of complementary 
facets of the all-sustaining and all-pervading Truth. Knowledge and 
Action, Arjuna believed, would lead him to the same Goal. Why then is he 
doomed or expected to wade through the bloodshed of war, enjoined by 
action? True, Arjuna 's mental sky was overcast with heavy clouds, but 
his psychic sky pined for true enlightenment. His mighty question is, ?If 
you consider knowledge superior to action, why urge me to this dreadful 
action ? ? 



297 



The Supreme Lord Krishna now says, ?Two paths, Arjuna, are there. I 
have already told you that. The Path of Knowledge and the Path of 
Action. Through the divine art of contemplation, the aspirant follows the 
Path of Knowledge. Through the dynamic urge of selfless work, the seeker 
follows the Path of Action. ? 

Knowledge feels that the world within is the real world. Action feels that 
the world without is the real world. The Path of Knowledge enters inside 
from outside, while the Path of Action enters outside from inside. 

4 Divine Incarnations 

Arjuna said: Your birth was later, and that of Visvasvan earlier. How should I 

understand that You taught this Yoga in the beginning? (4.04) 

The Supreme Lord said: Many births have I past through, as well as you have, O 

Arjuna; all these I know, but you do not know them, O Parantapa (O vanquisher 

of foes/ Arjuna). (4.05) 

Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all 

created things, yet by My own nature, I am born through My own Maya {the 

power of thought that produces form). (4.06) 

Whenever there is a decline of Dharma {righteousness) and Adharma 

{unrighteousness) grows powerfully, then, O Bharata {Arjuna), I manifest 

Myself. (4.07) 

For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the evildoers, for the 

establishment of righteousness, I am born from age to age. (See also Tr 

1.120.03-04) (4.08) 

He, who knows My divine birth and action {Karma), comes not to birth again on 

leaving the body, he comes to Me, O Arjuna. (4.09) 

Spiritual Masters are those rare beings who have realised there oneness 
with the Supreme, - the highest transcendental Consciousness. Spiritual 
Masters have not only realised their true self but also work selflessly to 
inspire humanity to seek the divinity within them. 

A real spiritual Master is able to expedite the progress of his/her disciples 
through their close connection to God and the grace of God. 

Spiritual Masters have taught the timeless spiritual truths in a variety of 
ways, Their teachings reflecting the environment and period in which they 
live. 



298 



Great Spiritual Masters like Krishna, Buddha and Jesus Christ have led 
to the formation of religions dedicated to following the teachings of these 
avatars. Each spiritual master has offered their own unique path towards 
the highest Truth. However although the outer forms may differ the 
ultimate realisation is the same. 



5 Knowledge and Ignorance 

The Lord accepts neither the evil nor even the good deed of anyone at all. 

Knowledge is enclosed by ignorance; thereby are mortals fooled. (5.15) 

But those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self: their 

knowledge, is like the sun, shedding light on "That" (tat), the Supreme 

(Brahman). (5.16) 

Thinking on That (the Supreme), merged in That, established in That, devoted to 

That alone, they step to the state from which there is no return, their sins washed 

away by knowledge. (5.17) 

Sages see the selfsame thing (sama) in a Brahmana (priest, intellectual class in 

India) with learning and humility, as in a cow or elephant, also in a dog, or even 

an outcast. (See also 6.29) (5.18) 

Even here on earth, the created is conquered by them whose mind is stilled in 

equality. For Brahman is devoid of imperfection and ever the same (sama); 

therefore, they stand still in Brahman. (See also 18.55 and ChU 2.23.0) (5.19) 

He who knows Brahman never rejoices in attaining some pleasant thing, nor 

grieves when the unpleasant comes his way; steadfast and stilled his mind 

unconfused, that knower of Brahman (Supreme Being) is established in 

Brahman. (5.20) 

His self detached from contacts with the outside world, finds the joy (sukha) 

which is in the Self, having the self engaged in the contemplation of Brahman, 

he attains unending bliss. (5.21) 

Ignorance wants to conquer; but knowledge wants to illumine. Ignorance 
wants to conquer the world by fighting, strangling and killing. Knowledge 
wants to illumine the world by loving and right human relations and so 
becoming one with the world in peace and mutual understanding. 
Ignorance is hunger for constant separativeness. Knowledge is longing 
for persevering unity. Ignorance teaches us how to consciously or 
unconsciously bring to the fore the destructive, animal qualities of the 
world. Knowledge teaches us how to dive deep within and bring to the 
fore the illumining, divine qualities to the external world. I come, I see, I 
conquer: this is the message of ignorance. Hove, I serve, I become: this is 
the message of knowledge. I come into the world, I see and feel the 
Supreme 's creation around me and I want to conquer it, dominate it, and 



299 



be lord and master over it. This is the message of ignorance within. 
Knowledge within me teaches me to love and serve the world and to 
become the Supreme 's instrument in this world. By listening to the 
knowledge in total selflessness, the silent voice within me, I love and serve 
the Supreme Lord and I grow into my inner Being, the Highest Reality, 
and that is oneness with the Supreme Lord. 

6 Who is the Yogi? And, directions for meditation 

Let the Yogi constantly concentrate his mind on yoga, remaining alone in a 

solitary place, with mind and body under full control, free from desires and 

attachment to material possessions. (6.10) 

Let him for himself set up a firm seat in a clean place, neither too high nor yet 

too low, on the sacred kusa grass, covered with a deer-skin and over it a cloth. 

(6.11) 

There let him sit, and making the mind one-pointed, with the motions of thought 

and senses restrained, fixed on his seat practise yoga for the purification of the 

Self. (6.12) 

Remaining still, holding the body, head and neck erect, let him fix his gaze on 

the tip of his nose, without looking around. (6.13) 

Serene minded, fearless, firm in the vow of celibacy {of the Brahmachari), the 

mind controlled, thinking on Me in total concentration, with intent on Me as the 

supreme goal. (See also 4.29, 5.27, 8.10 and 8.12) (6.14) 

So, the Yogi ever integrated in the Self, his mind restrained, attains to the peace 

which has Nirvana (nirvana...) as its end, and which subsists in Me. 

(...paramdm). (6.15) 

However, O Arjuna, yoga is not for him, who eats too much, nor for him who 

does not eat at all; nor for him who sleeps too much, nor yet for him who stays 

awake too long. (6.16) 

But, yoga is for him who is regulated (yukta) in food and recreation, who is 

regulated in all his deeds and gestures, who is regulated in sleeping as in 

walking, achieving a yoga which destroys all pain. (6.17) 

When the well-controlled mind is established in the Self alone, free from 

longing after all desirable things, then it is said, that the one is at peace. (6.18) 

As a lamp may stand not flickering in a windless place - this has been likened 

with the disciplined mind of a Yogi, absorbed in the yoga of the Self. (6.19) 

When the mind is at rest, quieted by the practise of yoga; when seeing the Self 

by the Self, he finds fulfilment in his own Self. (6.20) 

When he knows that utmost joy which, transcending the senses, can be grasped 

by the intellect; when standing still (in the Self), he never departs from reality. 

(See also KaU 3.12) (6.21) 



300 



When, having reached it, he thinks that there is no greater acquisition beyond it; 
therein established, he is not dislodged by any sorrow, even in the greatest 
suffering: (6.22) 

That state is known by the name of yoga (viyogan), the unlinking from the union 
with pain. This is the yoga which must be brought about with firm resolve and 
an undismayed mind. (6.23) 

MORE DIRECTIONS ON THE PRACTISE OF YOGA 

Abandoning without remainder all desires which arise from thought, controlling 

the senses from every side by the mind; (6.24) 

His intellect held fast in steadfastness, let he come little by little to rest, having 

made the mind abide in the Self, thinking of nothing else. (6.25) 

By whatever matter the flickering and unsteady mind wanders away, he should 

hold it back, and subject it to the Self alone. (6.26) 

THE RESULT OF DHYANA-YOGA 

Supreme bliss is for the Yogi whose mind is stilled, whose passion is laid to rest, 

who is sinless, and of the nature of Brahman. (6.27) 

The Yogi, in this way, always integrating the Self, freed from all sins, attains 

with ease the infinite bliss of Brahman's touch. (6.28) 

He, whose self is integrated in yoga, sees the Self abiding in all beings, and all 

beings in the Self, seeing the same everywhere. (See also 4.35, 5.18) (6.29) 

He, who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me, for him I am not lost, 

nor is he lost for Me. (6.30) 

He, who embraces unity, worships Me as abiding in all beings, that Yogi lives in 

Me, whatever his mode of life. (6.31) 

O Arjuna, he who, in comparison with himself, sees the same everywhere in 

pleasure as in pain, he is considered to be the perfect Yogi. (6.32) 

To come to a realization of Yoga and eventually call oneself a Yogi is 
therefore not an easy endeavour. Who knows how many years, lifetimes of 
practice it may take, but if we have faith and can inquire honestly into 
what a genuine tradition may teach us, we will certainly get closer step by 
step, rather than run with fancy in the wrong direction. 

To most of us the subject of Yoga is a recent phenomenon, let us therefore 
not be too hasty in defining it, but rather seek support from the Classical 
Indian Yoga tradition and see if our articulations of Yoga bear any 
similarities to that. Yoga should indeed be practical, but unless it bears 
any similarities to the Classical sources that define it, can we ever call it 
Yoga ? 



301 



The Bhagavad-Gita is a marvellous work on Yoga that spans over 
eighteen chapters. It is a synthesis of all the major Upanishads and 
without compare the most frequent book read in India over the past two- 
thousand years. It is a dialogue between the heroic warrior Arjuna and 
Krishna, an incarnation of God in support of the upkeep of Dharma, 
righteousness. The story takes place on a battlefield right before the battle 
are about to commence. Surveying the situation the heroic warrior Arjuna 
is overcome by faint-heartedness and refuses to stand up and fight. His 
head droops with a troubled mind incapable of action, but Krishna 
gradually installs in him the courage to act out his Dharma, duty, after 
explaining to Arjuna the various principles of Yoga. 

In the second chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita, the Supreme Lord Krishna 
begins his exposition of Yoga. After giving a brief overview of this 
immortal essence within us all, the Supreme Lord Krishna introduces the 
notion of Karma Yoga, the law of action, how to gain clarity from within 
although caught up in endless activity of the senses. The overall purpose 
is of course to not let actions lead us astray by simply acting out our 
fancies or mere desires, but rather allow the clarity of Yoga to be 
awakened in us by following certain observances while acting out our 
inescapable duties and responsibilities the Bhagavad-Gita 2:47-50: 

Your concern is with the respective action alone; its fruits are never 

within your control. So, let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let 

your attachment be the non-performance of action. (2.47) 

O Dhannanjaya (Arjuna), steadfast in devotion perform your action, 

casting off attachment, remaining the same in success and failure. 

Equilibrium is called yoga (Karma-yoga). (2.48) 

Truly, mere action is far inferior to devotion in wisdom (buddhi-yoga). O 

Dhananjaya (Arjuna), take refuge in wisdom (buddhi). Piteous are they 

whose motive is in the fruit (of action). (2.49) 

He, who is fixed in wisdom, discards both good and evil works. Therefore, 

take refuge in yoga (spiritual discipline on the way of oneness with the 

Supreme Being). Yoga is skill in action. (2.50) 

7 Realising the Supreme Lord through Meditation 

The Supreme Lord said: With the mind attached to Me, O Partha, engaged in 
yogic practices, taking refuge in Me, hear now how you shall know Me fully and 
without doubt. (7.01) 

I shall completely teach you this knowledge combined with experience, leaving 
nothing unsaid. This knowing, there remains nothing left to be known. (See also 
MuU 1.01.03) (7.02) 



302 



Among thousands of men, one maybe will strive for perfection; and even among 
those who strive having won perfection, only one, maybe, know Me as I really 
am. (7.03) 

After having realised that the Atma as the one full of knowledge in 
absolute servitude to the Supreme Lord, the automatic wish would be to 
realise his lordship. So Krishna explains his omnipresent , omnipotent 
and omniscient nature. He is the Creator and Saviour. His greatness is 
unparelled. This jiva entangled in prakriti and bound by three gunas is 
taken far away from realising the paramatma. However, who surrenders 
to the Lord is uplifted from this endless cycle of Samsara. Four types of 
human beings does not worship the Lord and four types of devotees do 
worship HIM. One may prostrate before HIM to for wordly pleasures, or 
for enjoying one 's own atma or for enjoying Krishna. The last one is " 
Bhakta" who is the most loved by Krishna. Such Bhaktha is always 
wanting to be with Krishna and cannot survive even for a moment without 
meditating upon HIM. Sri Krishna is all praise for such Bhakta in this 
chapter. It takes many births to be become such a Bhakta. 

8 The Seven Things to be Realised through Meditation 

Arjuna said: What is That (tad) Brahman? What is Adhyatma (spiritual light, 

self-knowledge), and what is action (Karma), O Purushottama (O Krsna). And, 

what is Adhibhuta (contingent beings, the physical region)! Also, what is called 

Adhidaiva (the spiritual or divine region)! (8.01) 

What is the meaning of Adhiyajna (the Lord of sacrifice), and who is in this 

body, O Madhusudana (Krsna)! Also, how at the time of death, are you to be 

known by the self-controlled? (8.02) 

The Supreme Lord said: The Imperishable (Akshara) is Brahman, the Supreme 

Being (Cosmic Intelligence); His essential nature (svabhdva) is called Adhyatma 

(Self-knowledge); the creative force (visarga) is known as 'action' (karma); 

(8.03) 

Knowledge of Adhibhuta (of contingent beings) is My perishable existence, and 

Purusha (god-man, living entity, living soul) is the divine (spiritual) region 

(Adhidaivata). The Adhiyajna (the Lord of sacrifice, Entity of sacrifice) tells of 

Me here in this body, O best of the embodied (Arjuna). (8.04) 

The one, who, at the time of death, leaving the body goes forth thinking of Me 

alone, accedes to My divinity (mad-bhdva), there is no doubt about this. (See 

also PrU 3.10) (8.05) 

On whatever form (bhdva) a man thinks about at the time of passing, that alone 

does he accede, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because he has ever been engaged in 

the thought thereof. (8.06) (See also ChU 3. 14.01) (8.06) 



303 



Therefore, at all times only remember Me and fight. With mind and intellect 

fixed on Me, you will without doubt come to Me. (8.07) 

Let one's thoughts be integrated in the yoga of constant practice, not going over 

to anything else; so, by constantly meditating, O Partha (Arjuna) , one reaches 

the Supreme, Resplendent Purusha (the All-Highest). (8.08) 

One who meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient Seer, the Ruler of all things, 

smaller than the atom, the Dispenser of all, whose form is inconceivable, who is 

as radiant as the sun beyond the darkness; (8.09) 

And who, at the time of death, with a steady (yukta) mind sustained by devotion, 

and the power of yoga properly fixing the vital breath (prdna) right between the 

eyebrows, he reaches the Supreme, Resplendent Purusha. (8.10) 

1) Transcendence: This is one of the great mysteries of the human 
condition: Why are we never content to simply be? We are always seeking 
the "more": to discover a new world, to rise above ourselves, to take it 
("it" being whatever we happen to be involved in right now) to "the next 
level. " Not satisfied to know where we are, we want to know where we 
came from and where we are going. Not satisfied with the self-defined, 
self-oriented reality of our "natural" existence, we strive for a self- 
obliterating union with the Supreme Lord. 

2) Vitality: Our transcendent self has a twin - our vital, animal self. And 
while the animal self comes with no mean load of negative baggage 
(selfishness, greed, lust, vanity, cruelty...), selfhood has its positive points 
as well: a will-power, passion and energy that the more "spiritual" self 
could never muster. The trick, of course, is to channel it to the right 
places. 

3) Joy: A happy person is an open book. Everything gushes forth; his 
personality flows free, without restraint and inhibition. Joy is the 
battering ram that breaks down barriers and constraints, whether they are 
internal or external, imagined or real... 

4) Awareness: Knowledge is more than power: it is the ability to involve 
oneself fully in one's life and actions. A deed done in ignorance is a stab 
in the dark; a deed born out of knowledge is focused and effective. A deed 
done in ignorance is disjointed, alienâ€” the deed of a stranger even to the 
one who does it; a deed born out of knowledge is an integral deedâ€” an 
extension of, and enhancement to, the totality of the doer... 

5) Action: And yet, there are times when the imperative is simply: Do! 
The ability to act because action is required, even if knowledge and 



304 



understanding are lacking, even if it is "out of character" for us, is an all- 
importantâ€” and redeemingâ€” feature of the human soul. 

6) Struggle: There is another great mystery of the human state: the fact 
that we are at our most innovative and resourceful when faced by limits 
and constrictions. It may be as benign as the deadline for an office project 
or as momentous as a national crisisâ€” we're at our best when we're 
pressed, and our most sublime juices are squeezed out of us in response to 
challenging, even oppressive, conditions. This is the sixth soul-quality, 
represented by the "olive" -the power to translate challenge and 
adversary into a potent force for transformation and achievement... 

7) Tranquility: Like everything else, struggle has a flip-side: the blessings 
of tranquillity. Even deeper than its "olive" lies the "date" of the soul: its 
core of tranquil perfection which nothing -neither the turmoil's of the 
spirit, the vicissitudes of society, nor the upheavals of history -can disturb 
or even touch. And this well of harmony does not just sit there in the inner 
recesses of our soul-we have the power to bore down into ourselves, to 
access it and tap it, to create for ourselves a space of immutable truth and 
perfect peace amidst the storms that batter our lives. 

9 Brahma- Jnana is the best Philosophy 

The Supreme Lord said: Since you are not disapproving, I shall now declare to 

you this greatest mystery of knowledge (jnana) compatible with experience 

(vyndna), and as by knowing it, you will be delivered from evil. (09.01) 

This is kingly science, kingly secret, the supreme sanctifier, immediately 

realisable, unopposed to Dharma (conformed to righteousness), very easy to 

carry out, and abiding forever. (09.02) 

O Parantapa (O vanquisher of foes, Arjuna), men who have no faith in this 

Dharma (law of righteousness), fail to reach Me, but return to the path of the 

mortal world. (9.03) 

Brahma Jnana and Atma Jnana for all practical purposes mean the same 
thing. Knowing the essence of a grain of sand... it is not difficult to 
decipher what the mound is made of! If a grain of sand is single soul 
atman... the whole mound Brahma himself (the creative attribute of the 
Supreme). The knower of self finally realizes the identity of God 
Almighty... the nature of our real self! 

It is our Soul (Higher Self) Atman that has manifested the body and not 
vice versa. It is not within the capability of the body to manifest a Soul 
(Higher Self) Atman. Every Soul Atman manifests body after another to 



305 



work out its karma... remove the impurities dross within! Similar as metal 
within an ore cannot separate itself on its own and requires external 
mining machinery... processes for the same; our soul atman also requires 
a body to work out its karma... remove the dross within! 

Knowing Brahma... the identity of the Supreme Lord is the crux of life for 
every human being. The moment one comes in communion with the 
Supreme Lord on a permanent basis... the spiritual quest ends! Nowhere 
further to go... the liberated Soul Atman finally finds a seat in the abode of 
the Supreme Lord... the kingdom of the Supreme Lord (aka Vaikuntha in 
Hinduism). 

One becomes enlightened the moment we gain Atma Jnana (aka Brahma 
jnana)! Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ and prophet 
Mohammed... all attained... rather reached the level of Brahma Jnani... 
Atman Jnani in their lifetime! 

Nirvikalpa Samadhi is not the path... it is an end in itself! The moment one 
gains Brahma Jnana... Atma Jnana one finally reaches the stage of 
Nirvikalpa Samadhi when one can have a communion with the Supreme 
Lord on one-to-one basis and that too permanently! Reaching the stage of 
Nirvikalpa Samadhi is the goal of every sage and saint. Nirvikalpa 
Samadhi is the stage when one reaches the stage of nothingness 
permanently. 

And what does nothingness mean? Every human being every moment of 
life invokes thousands of thoughts mostly involuntarily! Unless we stop 
the flow of these involuntary thoughts... we would not scale higher levels 
on the spiritual path! Gaining control of the five senses and the mind is 
the foremost requirement to reach the stage of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. 

Establishing complete control over the five senses and the mind is the 
most difficult task for one in a Grihastha ashram (family life). No sooner 
the flow of incessant thoughts to our brain almost stops... we reach the 
stage of Nirvikalpa Samadhi... the stage of thoughtlessness... 
nothingness... when nothing remains except the purified Soul Atman and 
the Supreme Lord! 

Brahma Jnana... Atma Jnana can be achieved following the path 
prescribed in the Sacred Bhagavad Gita... the doctrine given to mankind 
by the Supreme Lord Krishna in Mahabharata! The moment complete 
dross within the Soul Atman removes... one realizes true inner self... the 
assessment that it is not the human being but the soul atman within that is 
on its cosmic journey dawns upon one! 



306 



Realizing our true nature... our real self is the goal of every human life... 
every living form! The human stage is the last leg in the cosmic life cycle. 
It is only in the human form one finally reaches the stage of enlightenment 
and finally salvation. The journey for the Soul Atman in the human form is 
the noblest experience for it knows... Only as a human being shall it reach 
the end of cosmic life! 

10 Knowledge of the Supreme Lord's glory fosters yoga 

He who knows in truth that sovereignty and yoga of Mine, is endowed with firm 

yoga. Herein there is no doubt. (10.07 

I am the origin of all; all things evolve from Me: this knowing, the wise 

commune perseveringly with (bha-j) Me. (See also RV 8.58.02) (10.08) 

With their minds fixed on Me, with their life hidden in Me, enlightening one 

another, ever conversing about Me, they are happy and joyful. (10.09) 

And since they are ever integrated and commune with (bhaj-) Me in love ipriti), 

I give them the yoga of discrimination {buddhi-yoga, the discipline of mind), by 

which they draw near to Me. (10.10) 

Out of pure loving concern for them, within their Self, I dispel the darkness born 

of ignorance by the shining lamp of knowledge. (10. 1 1) 



"Knowledge does not come about from practice of yoga methods alone. 
Perfection in knowledge is in fact only for those who begin by practice of 
virtue [dharma ]. Yet, without yoga as a means, knowledge does not 
come about. The practice ofyogic methods is not the means by itself yet it 
is only out of that practice of yoga that the perfection in knowledge comes 
about. And so it is said by the teachers: 'Yoga is for the purpose of 
knowledge of truth' " So, wrote Shankara. 

Patanjali very carefully and fully outlines the elements of the support 
needed by the aspirant, giving invaluable information on how to 
guarantee success in yoga. 

The first Yoga Sutra says: "Now the exposition of yoga, " implying that 
there must be something leading up to yoga in the form of necessary 
developments of consciousness and personality. These prerequisites may 
be thought of as the Pillars of Yoga, and are known as Yama and 
Niyama. 

Yama and Niyama 

Yama and Niyama are often called "the Ten Commandments of Yoga. " 
Each one of these Five Don'ts (Yama) and Five Do's (Niyama) is a 



307 



supporting, liberating Pillar of Yoga. Yama means self-restraint in the 
sense of self-mastery, or abstention, and consists of five elements. Niyama 
means observances, of which there are also five. Here is the complete list 
of these ten Pillars as given in Yoga Sutras 2:30-32: 

l)Ahimsa: non-violence, non-injury, harmlessness 

2) Satya: truthfulness, honesty 

3) Asteya: non-stealing, honesty, non-misappropriativeness 

4) Brahmacharya: sexual continence in thought, word and deed as well 
as control of all the senses 

5) Aparigraha: non-possessiveness, non-greed, non-selfishness, non- 
acquisitiveness 

6) Shaucha: purity, cleanliness 

7) Santosha: contentment, peacefulness 

8) Tapas: austerity, practical (i.e., result-producing) spiritual discipline 

9) Swadhyaya: introspective self-study, spiritual study 

10) Ishwarapranidhana: offering of one's life to God 

All of these deal with the innate powers of the human being-or rather with 
the abstinence and observance that will develop and release those powers 
to be used toward our spiritual perfection, to our self-realization and 
liberation. 



11 The whole Teaching of the Gita summarised 

Perform actions for Me, and make Me your highest goal, be loyal in love 
(bhakta) to me, be unattached, have no hatred for any being at all: for all who do 
so come to Me, O Pandava (Arjuna). (See also 8.22) (11.55) 

The Gita is a source of power and wisdom. It strengthens you when you 
are weak, and inspires you when you feel rejected and feeble. It teaches 
you how to resist unrighteousness and follow the path of virtue and 
righteousness. 



308 



The Gita is not merely a book or just a scripture. It is a living voice 
carrying an eternally indispensable and vital message to mankind. Its 
verses embody words of wisdom coming from the infinite ocean of 
knowledge, the Absolute Itself. 

The voice of the Gita is the call of the Supreme. It is the divine sound 
explained. The primal source of all existence, all power, is the manifested 
sound - AUM (OM). This is the Divine Word. It is Nada Brahman, whose 
unceasing call is: "Be ye all ever merged in the eternal, unbroken, 
continuous consciousness of the Supreme Truth." This is the sublime 
message that the Gita elaborates and presents in all comprehensiveness 
and in a universally acceptable form. 

12 Reasons for Worshipping a Personal Form of the Supreme 

But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; for 

the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach. (12.05) 

However, those who renounce their every action to Me, solely intent on Me as 

the Supreme Goal, and worship Me, meditating on Me, with steadfast devotion, 

(12.06) 

These I will soon lift up on high out of the ocean of the mortal samsara {the 

round of birth, death and rebirth), O Partha (Arjuna), for their minds are fixed 

on Me. (12.07) 

Fix your mind on Me only, and let your intellect dwell within Me; then in very 

truth (eva) you will abide hereafter in Me alone. (12.08) 



Let us experience a stillness beyond all stillness, an absolute and total 
stillness, a condition prior to all manifestation, movement, and change. 
Let us experience a stupendous silence empty of all noise, whether outer 
chatter or inner rumination, whether outer manifestation or inner 
movement; for it is the condition before all expression, prior to thinking 
and speaking, prior to the Word of the Gita. 

Entering the Silence of our inner-selves, we become aware of being afield 
that cannot be called a space; for it includes all space and time as an 
unfoldment within it, but does not touch its pristine stillness and silence. 
In the Silence of Meditation, we are the prior, prior to all. We are the 
immovable, the unchanging, the mysterious ground of all movement and 
change. Movement and change are the manifestation that arises within it 
without ever disturbing its stillness and peace, without ever touching its 
silence and emptiness. We are prior to all manifestation, the source from 
which creation emerges, and the mystery to which it returns. We are the 
beginning and the end of everything, the truth without which there will be 



309 



no awareness, and no experience. Here, we find ourselves in the 
"Presence" of the Supreme Lord. Meditation helps us to enter into the 
Sacred Silence and in the Presence of the Supreme Lord. This same idea 
is with the formless and unmanifested God and God in a certain form, the 
manifested God, or Supreme Being. The formless God is like the ocean, 
which cannot be of any help to us directly. But when it manifests its self in 
a certain form, it becomes a great help and guidance in our lives, like the 
Supreme Lord Krishna. Unmanifested or manifested, the supreme Lord is 
ONE. 

Now it is clear that God, the Supreme, is in both manifested and unmanifested 
forms. According to this there are two types of devotees "Nirguna Upaasak" 
(worshipper of the Unmanifest) and "Sagun Upaasak" (worshipper of God 
possessed with forms and attributes). Amongst these the path of the "Sagun 
Upaasak" is the most practical. 

Since our birth we perceive everything in names and forms. It is very hard for us 
to concentrate on the abstract. As human beings we are very much centred in 
our body which makes it very difficult for us to meditate upon the Unmanifest. 
The strain is much greater for the "Nirguna Upaasak", [see Gita 12:5]. For the 
"Sagun Upaasak" it is easier to attain atonement with the Unmanifest. When you 
meditate upon the Supreme God in a manifested form, it also includes the 
Unmanifest, because manifested or unmanifested, God is one. 
"But, greater is the difficulty of those whose minds cling to the Unmanifested; 
for the goal of the Unmanifested is hard for the embodied being to reach. " (Gita 
12.05) 

13 Prakriti and Purusha comprise everything 

Arjuna said: What is Prakriti and Purusha (Matter and Spirit)! What is the 

'Field' and what is the "Knower of the Field'? Also, what is knowledge and that 

which ought to be known? These, Kesava (Krsna), I would like to know. (Most 

MSS omit this verse.) 

The Supreme Lord said: This body, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), is called the 'Field' 

(ksetra), and he who knows it, is the 'Knower of the Field' (ksetrajha), by the 

Sages who understand these things. (13.01) 

Recognise Me as the Knower of the Field in all Fields (ksetras), O Bharata 

(Arjuna). Knowledge of the Field and the Knower of the Field is in My opinion 

true knowledge. (13.02) 

What the Field (ksetra) is and what it is like, what its modifications (changes, 

associations, transformations) are and which derives from which, and who He is 

(ksetrajna, the Knower of the Field), and what his powers (var: nature) are, hear 

now briefly from Me. (13.03) 



310 



In the Samkhya School of Indian philosophy, Prakriti and Purusha are the 
material nature and the soul. Prakriti is material nature in its germinal 
state, eternal and beyond perception. When it comes into contact with the 
soul or self (purusha), it starts a process of evolution that leads through 
several stages to the creation of the existing material world. In the 
Samkhya view, only prakriti is active; the self, trapped in materiality, does 
nothing but observe and experience. The Self escapes from prakriti by 
recognizing its total difference from and noninvolvement in the material 
world. 

"You must understand that both Prakriti and Brahman (Purusha) are 
without beginning. All evolution and all the gunas proceed from 
Prakriti. " (Bhagavad Gita 13:19) This explanatory translation is not 
without value, but the literal meaning is important: "Know that Prakriti 
(matter, nature) and Purusha (Self, Atmd, Spirit) are both without 
commencement; and know also that changes (modifications, 
associations, transformations) and constituents (Gunas, the three modes 
of Matter or Nature) arise from Prakriti (matter, nature). (13.19)" 

This verse is quite pivotal for our correct understanding. First of all, both 
prakriti and purusha are eternal-without beginning, and therefore 
without end. This means that prakriti is not a dream or mirage, something 
that will cease to exist when realization is attained, though our mistaken 
ideas about prakriti will melt away. Next, all "things" originate in 
prakriti, and so do their modifications; for the gunas, the primal building 
blocks of manifestation, themselves are prakriti. (chapter or discourse 
fourteen will be about the three gunas.) 

Two important ideas come into play here: 1) Nothing either comes from 
spirit (purusha) or is done by purusha. 2) As Poe said: "All that we see or 
seem is but a dream within a dream "-namely, prakriti, the creative 
energy. 

"From Prakriti the evolution of body and senses is said to originate. The 
sense of individuality in us is said to cause our experience of pleasure and 
pain. " (Bhagavad-Gita 13:20) This is extremely difficult to translate. The 
idea is that prakriti is the source of both action and the instrument of 
action, but purusha is the source of the internal experiences and internal 
reactions- "our experience of pleasure and pain "-that result from the 
movements of prakriti. Consciousness is an attribute of the purusha. The 
more conscious we are-the more we identify with consciousness itself 
rather than objects of consciousness-the more "real" we are. 



311 



Prakriti (matter, nature) is said to be the source cause, of the production 
of the body and the senses (effect and instruments). Purusha (Self, Atma, 
Spirit) is said to be the cause, in the experience of pleasures and pains. 
(13.20) 

We experience the different modes (gunas) of materiality, and our 
reaction to them-whether positive or negative-intensely attaches our 
awareness to prakriti. The character of our attachment/aversion 
determines the kind of birth we will have. Most translators speak of "good 
and evil " wombs, and Prabhavananda has "pure or impure, " but the 
Sanskrit says sadasadyonijanmasu-Â£z>t/z in real (sat) and unreal (asat) 
wombs, or birth in true/real or false wombs. This is a purely 
psychic/spiritual expression. Sentient beings within prakriti exist in a vast 
scale from totally ignorant and basically unconscious up to subtle and 
expanded consciousness that approximates and reflects the Consciousness 
that is Brahman. It is this degree of reflection of the divine consciousness 
that determines how "real " or "unreal " the birth and body will be. The 
closer to the Supreme Lord we are, the more real we are, and the further 
away we are, the more unreal we are. This is completely psychological, 
not spatial. Nevertheless it should make us think carefully about every 
aspect of our life-including those we associate with. How real are we, 
and how real is our life? If we wish to approach Reality and unite with It, 
this is a basic requisite. A sure sign that an aspirant will fail in spiritual 
life is his neglect of this crucial search. 

14 Knowledge of the Origin of Creation is basic for Salvation 

The Supreme Lord said: Once again I will proclaim the supreme knowledge, the 
best of all knowledges (jnana, doctrine, metaphysical or spiritual knowledge), 
on knowing this, all Sages (Munis) have from this world gone to the supreme 
Perfection. (14.01) 

With this knowledge as their refuge, they reached an order of existence 
equivalent to (sddharmya) My own nature, and are not reborn at the time of 
creation, nor do they fail at the time of dissolution. (14.02) 

The Sages who have been really blessed with Self-knowledge have nothing 
more to gain. It is the Supreme Knowledge. While "jnana", doctrine, 
metaphysical or spiritual knowledge, is the easiest to acquire for those 
who have purified their minds. It is the hardest and the least understood 
for those whose minds are steeped in worldliness. Knowledge as to the 
Supreme Lord is the real and only true knowledge. However, is "error" is 
committed frequently, Self-knowledge requires to be expounded frequently 
and in a variety of ways. 



312 



One principal way that the "jnana, " the yogi of discernment, meditates is 
to patiently release or put aside all thoughts and feelings until the 
luminous glow of the Higher self (Soul) dawns in the mind and heart and 
is allowed to do a work of transformation and enlightenment within the 
rapt meditator. 

Whenever a thought or feeling which is not the goal of the meditation â€” 
that is, which is not the soul, the inner self â€” occurs to the mind, the 
meditator simply says, "Not this, not this,"(Neti-neti meditation) and 
dismisses the thought, image, concept, sound, or sense distraction. 

Jnana, also called Jnana Yoga is the Yoga of true knowledge, which 
incessantly strives to know and understand the difference between the real 
and unreal, the permanent and the temporary. The spiritual path of Jnana 
Yoga was described as a straight, but steep course, by Sadananad in his 
Vedanta-Sara, a fifteen century text. Jnana Yoga preaches that there are 
four means of salvation. According to Jnana Yoga, the person should be 
able to detach himself/herself from everything that is temporary, after 
following the spiritual path. It also aims to attain tranquillity, the control 
of the mind and the senses, endurance, faith and the ability for perfect 
concentration. 

It is a popular belief that Jnana Yoga is based on the Hindu philosophy of 
non-dualism. Contrary to the assumption, the spiritual path of Yoga also 
finds its place in many branches of Buddhism, including Zen, Islamic 
Sufism and some branches of Christianity that follow the Gnostic Gospel 
of Thomas. Jnana Yoga emphasizes on the use of mind to surpass or 
discern the mind. It aims to explore knowledge. There are the Eight Limbs 
of Yoga in Jnana Yoga. The person, who follows this spiritualpath, attains 
self-discipline, hears the truth and reflects upon it. There is an urge in the 
person to attain freedom from whatever is temporary. 

The "liberation " is attainted through knowledge, rather than following 
rituals and ceremonies. However, not everyone is knowledgeable. 
Knowledge is limited to the special few people, who are prepared for 
sound examination and clear judgment of the nature of consciousness. 
This knowledge is attained only if the person goes through conclusions of 
the seers by reading scriptures, accumulated through millions of years. 
The knowledge, thus accumulated, is examined by the individual in the 
light of his own intelligence and then comes to his own realization. After 
going through this rigorous process of Jnana Yoga, the person seeking the 



313 



knowledge ultimately gains insight, the ability to discriminate what is 
true, and what is untrue. 

The benefits of Jnana Yoga are manifold. The person, who follows this 
spiritual path of Jnana Yoga, attains tranquillity, which is the art of 
remaining calm even in the face of adversity. Self-control in one's own self 
is attained by following Jnana Yoga. Another benefit of following this 
spiritual path is cessation, or keeping one's self abstained from the 
actions that are irrelevant to the maintenance of the body and the pursuit 
of inner- enlightenment. After a significant period, the person even attains 
endurance. He/she is remains unruffled by the play of the opposites in 
Nature, such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain, praise and censure. 
Apart from this, the person remains single-minded in all the situations. 
He/she also becomes able to increase his/her concentration power. 

There are seven stages of Jnana or the seven Jnana Bhumikas. 

First, Jnana should be developed through a deep study of Atma Jnana 
Sastras and association with the wise and the performance of virtuous 
actions without any expectation of fruits. This is Subheccha or good 
desire, which forms the first Bhumika or stage of Jnana. This will irrigate 
the mind with the waters of discrimination and protect it. There will be 
non-attraction or indifference to sensual objects in this stage. The first 
stage is the substratum of the other stages. 

From it the next two stages, viz., Vicharana and Tanumanasi will be 
reached. Constant Atma Vichara (Atmic enquiry) forms the second stage. 

The third stage is Tanumanasi. This is attained through the cultivation of 
special indifference to objects. The mind becomes thin like a thread. 
Hence the name Tanumanasi. Tanu means thread - threadlike state of 
mind. The third stage is also known by the name Asanga Bhavana. In the 
third stage, the aspirant is free from all attractions. If any one dies in the 
third stage, he will remain in heaven for a long time and will reincarnate 
on earth again as a Jnani. The above three stages can be included under 
the Jagrat state. 

The fourth stage is Sattvapatti. This stage will destroy all Vasanas to the 
root. This can be included under the Svapana state. The world appears 
like a dream. Those who have reached the fourth stage will look upon all 
things of the universe with an equal eye. 

The fifth stage is Asamsakti. There is perfect non-attachment to the 
objects of the world. There is no Upadhi or waking or sleeping in this 



314 



stage. This is the Jivanmukti stage in which there is the experience of 
Ananda Svaroopa (the Eternal Bliss of Brahman) replete with spotless 
Jnana. This will come under Sushupti. 

The sixth stage is Padartha Bhavana. There is knowledge of Truth. The 
seventh stage is Turiya, or the state of super consciousness. This is 
Moksha. This is also known by the name Turiyatita. There are no 
Sankalpas. All the Gunas disappear. This is above the reach of mind and 
speech. 

Disembodied salvation (Videhamukti) is attained in the seventh stage. 

Remaining in the certitude of Atma, without desires, and with an equal 
vision over all, having completely eradicated all complications of 
differentiations of'Vor 'he', existence or non-existence, is Turiya. 

Retire into your meditation chamber. Sit on Padma, Siddha, Svastika or 
Sukha Asana to begin with. Relax the muscles. Close the eyes. 
Concentrate on or gaze at the Sixth Chakra (Third Eye), the space 
between the two eyebrows. Repeat 'Om' mentally with Brahma-Bhavana. 
This Bhavana is a sine qua non, very very important. Silence the 
conscious mind. Repeat mentally, feel constantly: 

All-pervading ocean of Light I am OM OM OM 

Infinity I am OM OM OM 

All-pervading infinite Light I am OM OM OM 

Vyapaka Paripoorna Jyotirmaya Brahman I am OM OM OM 

Omnipotent I am OM OM OM 

Omniscient I am OM OM OM 

All Bliss I am OM OM OM 

Satchidananda I am OM OM OM 

All purity I am OM OM OM 

All glory I am OM OM OM 

15 The Path to the Goal 

Free from pride and ignorance, victorious over the vice of attachment, ever 
abiding in what concerns the Self, desire suppressed, released from the pairs of 
opposites (all dualities) made known in pleasure as in pain, they tread, 
undeluded, that Eternal Goal (place, region). (15.05) 

Nor does the sun lights there, nor moon, nor fire. That is My supreme abode 
(dhdma, home) from where, having reached it, no one returns. (See also 13.17 
and 15.12, and KaU 5.15, ShU 6.14, MuU 2.02.10) (15.06) 



315 



The ultimate purpose of Vedic knowledge is to detach oneself from the 
entanglement of the material world and to understand Lord Krishna as 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who understands Krishna's 
supreme identity surrenders unto Him and engages in His devotional 
service. In chapter fifteen Lord Krishna reveals the virtues, the glories 
and transcendental characteristics of God being omnipotent, omniscient 
and omnipresent. Also, He explains the purpose and value of knowing 
about God and the means by which He can be realized. In this way, the 
chapter is entitled: The Yoga of the Supreme Self. However, brutally 
retreating from the attachment to the world is a negative effect. It has, 
therefore, to be made to take a gradually but positive turn on the way to 
the Goal. Aspiring ardently is what is desired. Giving oneself over to 
Prakriti (matter), and giving oneself over to the Supreme Purusha, are 
opposed to each other, producing opposite results. The former breeds 
ignorance and promotes bondage to the wheel of birth and death, while 
the latter liberates and leads one to the plenitude of Brahman. The 
intensity and the completeness of the dedication to Brahman hastens the 
spiritual enlightenment of the "sadhaka ". A sddhaka (Sanskrit word) is 
someone who follows a particular sddhana, or a way of life designed to 
realize the goal of one's ultimate ideal, whether it is merging with 
Brahman or realization of one's personal deity. The word is related to the 
Sanskrit "sddhu", which is derived from the verb root sddh-, to 
accomplish. As long as one has yet to reach the goal, they are a sddhaka, 
while one who has reached the goal is called a siddha. In modern usage, 
sadhaka is often applied as a generic term for any religious practitioner. 
In medieval times it was more narrowly used as a technical term for one 
who had gone through a specific initiation As clouds come forth from the 
ocean, the Prakriti of the Eternal Activity ever streams forth from 
Brahman, the Supreme Purusha. The eternal process of the appearance 
and disappearance of "Prakriti " does not in any way affect the Supreme 
Lord God. The detachment from the Prakriti and the attachment to the 
Supreme Purusha are the potent means for the destruction of the tree of 
Samksara (impressions of past karma, or instinctive disposition of mind) 
of the "Jivatman" (individual Soul, the Higher Self). Ridding the mind of 
all impurities and fixing it on Atman, these are the twofold intents on 
which the "sadhaka " engages himself. The mind becomes all-powerful as 
it gains in purity; and, because of its purity it gains access to Atman. The 
greatest and holiest of its achievements remains in its getting fixed in the 
Atman. Man becomes another god through this act of the mind. On 
entering the ocean of the Supreme Abode, and getting merged in It, the 
nearing of "realization ", the "Jivatman " merges his individuality in the 
Paramatman (the Supreme, God, Para-Brahma, the Supersoul or Cosmic 
Consciousness). A man in a dark room does not cognize his body, but he 



316 



retains his feeling, "I am". The feeling is self-evident and sufficient. This 
awareness is called "Prajnanam" (the control of life forces in the body), 
the eternal factor in man. While seeming to play the game "hide and 
seek", "It" is actually ever "Itself". This awareness as "Pure 
Consciousness" is eulogised as the "Supreme State". It is infinite and 
immovable; it neither dies nor is it born, and unaffected by time, space 
and causation. The "Jivatman "(the individual Soul or Higher Self) who 
identifies himself with this Absolute Consciousness gains "Mukti" 
(freedom from rebirth, nirvana). 



16 The Scripture is a sure guide 

He, who forsakes the ordinances of scripture, and lives in the promptings 
of his own desires, attains not perfection, finding no comfort (sukha), nor 
the Supreme Goal. (16.23) 

Therefore, let the scripture be your authority, determining what is right 
and wrong. Once you know what the ordinance of scripture bids you to 
do, you should act accordingly in this world. (16.24) 



The Upanishads have their origin in the Vedas. The belief is that the 
Vedas are without a beginning. For this reason great sanctity is attached 
to them. However, the Bhagavad-Gita is an integral part of the 
Mahabharata, an epic that came into being only the other day (relatively). 
Despite its regency, the Bhagavad-Gita occupies a place pair with the 
Upanishads. 

The reason is not far away. The essence of all the Upanishads is 
contained in the Bhagavad-Gita. If those ancient books are cows, the Gita 
is their milk. Cows are of various hues and of differing stature. But the 
milk yielded by them is the same. Maintaining cows may not be possible 
for all. The laborious art of milking is not commonly known to all. But to 
partake of milk is the privilege of one and all. 

The choice of converting the milk into curds (yoghurt), butter and ghee is 
again in the hands of all. In similar manner, the Bhagavad-Gita may be 
treated as an easily available guide for life here and the hereafter 
(reincarnation). Besides, the cow cannot be taken wherever one chooses 
to go. In a preserved form milk may be transported anywhere. The idea is 
that one who has imbibed the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita need not 
take the trouble of probing into the rather terse contents of the 
Upanishads. 



317 



The Supreme Lord Krishna was gracious enough to clarify the abstract 
teachings of the Upanishads. Arjuna's craving for enlightenment was the 
immediate cause of this gracious clarification. Love of the calf induces the 
cow to secrete and yield milk in plenty. That bounteous supply goes to 
benefit many other parched mouths. This is the case with the Bhagavad- 
Gita also. 

Milk may be consumed in proportion to one 's digestive power. From the 
athlete down to the ailing, all can have recourse to it as a wholesome 
food. The utility of the Bhagavad-Gita is equally all ranging. It is an 
indispensable guide to a novice who has just commenced his spiritual 
development. Even to an adept who is at the proximity to the goal it has a 
message to deliver. 

Life both in its secular and sacred aspects gets abundantly enriched by 
the application of the tenets of the Bhagavad-Gita (the Song of God). For 
these reasons a status is conferred on the Bhagavad-Gita equal to that of 
the ancient Upanishads. 

Indeed, the battle as described in the Bhagavad-Gita is constantly taking 
place within ourselves; Because of Arjuna's faith and the Supreme Lord 
Krishna 's instruction, we can all gain insight into our own problems and 
struggles. 

All the events, great or small, magnificent and minute, taking place in the 
universe are verily the doings of Ishwara (the all pervading energy of 
Ksara Purusa)). The universe itself is the revelation of the glory of 
Ishwara. 

Among all these manifestations and revelations, the Bhagavad-Gita 
occupies a unique position. It explains the working of the universe and the 
divinity inherent in it. It expounds the laws governing human life. 

The bedrock which is the Source of the universe and the beings in it, is 
lucidly presented by it. Knowledge pertaining to the Divine and the 
mundane (the worldly) is all contained in it. 

To put it in another way, the ways and the means of attaining the Supreme 
and also of making earthly life prosperous and fruitful, are all 
convincingly conveyed through it. The follower of the Bhagavad-Gita 
would very soon become a yogi (self-developed). 



318 



For all these reasons the carrying of the message of this great and unique 
book to the prospective "sadhakas " (seekers of Truth) is a benign work. 
No other service is equal to this spiritual mission. 

The Importance of Daily Meditation 

It is the result of practice in one's life before, which gives seekers the inclination 
to seek the cause of existence in the present. The active mind is a normal 
condition which comes from the established habit of thinking about the daily 
affairs of life. Here meditation, practiced regularly, can be of great assistance. 

If we try to focus on the moons reflection in rough waters, it is difficult. So it is 
with meditation with a mind which is not still. The habitual movement of our 
mind is the main obstacle to our inner focus. 

This habit takes many years to change and requires the development of art. 
Those who wish to meditate have to become artists in that practice. This is one 
of the most difficult human practices in which few have right guidance.

Supplement: 

Two simple and One advanced Meditation 

Outline 



Two of the simplest techniques of meditation are presented here that does not 
need a guru (teacher) or any special mantra. Meditation leads to peace, 
tranquillity, and equanimity of mind, and equanimity of mind leads to Self- 
Realization or the superconscious state of mind and bliss. 



I 



Ten steps of Meditation: 

1. A dark room makes time stand still. 

2. A 1 inch cushion reduces ankle and knee pain. 

3. Set an alarm clock for the time that you vow to do. 

4. Keeping eyes closed and hands locked, periodically stretch legs while keeping 
back straight. 

5. Intense aspiration will bring longer meditation. 

6. Practice and regularity achieves perfection. 

7. Do meditation with love to seek and please God. 

8. Invoke God's presence before meditation. 

9. Keep your meditation secret from worldly people. 

10. Never give up until the goal is reached. 

Hope these 10 hints help your meditation. 



331 



II 



The scriptural knowledge has its place, but it is through direct realization that 
the inner core can be reached and the outer shell discarded. Meditation is the 
way to inner realization and should be learnt, personally, from a competent 
teacher. Realization of the true nature of mind leads to meditation. 

A simple technique of meditation is described here: 

(1) Wash your face, eyes, hands, and feet; and sit in a clean, quiet, and dark 
place using any comfortable posture, with head, neck, and spine straight and 
vertical. No music or incense during meditation is recommended. The time and 
place of meditation should be fixed. Follow the good principles of living, by 
thoughts, words, and deeds. Some yogic exercises are necessary. Midnight, 
morning, and evening are the best times to meditate for 15 to 25 minutes every 
day. 

(2) Remember any name or form of the personal god you believe in and ask His 
or Her blessings. 

(3) Close your eyes; take 5 to 10 very slow and deep breaths. 

(4) Fix your gaze, mind, and feelings inside the chest center, the seat of the 
causal heart, and breathe slowly. Mentally chant "Raa" as you breathe in and 
"Maa" as you breathe out. Think, as if breath itself is making these sounds Raa 
and Maa. Mentally visualize and follow the route of breath going in through the 
nostrils, up towards the mid-brows, and down to the chest center, or the lungs. 
Feel the breath and sensation in the body, and be alert. Do not try to control or 
lead your breathing just follow the natural breathing. 

(5) Direct the will towards the thought of merging yourself into the infinite 
space of the air you are breathing. If mind wanders away from following the 
breaths, start from step 

(5). Be regular, and persist without procrastination. 

The sound of OM or AUM is a combination of three primary sounds: 

A, U, and M. 

It is the source of all sounds one can utter. Therefore, it is the fittest sound 
symbol of Spirit. It is also the primeval impulse that moves our five nerve 
centres that control bodily functions. Yogananda calls OM the sound of the 



332 



vibration of the cosmic motor. The Bible says: In the beginning was the word 
(OM, Amen, Allah) and the word was with God, and the word was God (John 
1.01). This cosmic sound vibration is heard by yogis as a sound, or a mixture of 
sounds, of various frequencies. 



Ill 



For Advanced Meditators Only 

THE OMNIC SOUND TECHNIQUE 

It is strongly suggested that one should first practice the meditation techniques 
given as previously for at least three months and see the progress before going 
into this advanced technique. 

Before one can purify one's nature by mantra, one has to reach a level whereby 
one's system of consciousness becomes sensitive to any mantra. This means that 
one's mundane desires must be first fulfilled, or satisfied by detachment. One 
must become Saattvika first. This is just like cleaning the jewellery first before 
gold-plating it. 

This technique has been mentioned in Gita 8. 12-13 by Lord Krishna: 

"When one leaves the physical body by controlling all the senses; 
focusing the mind on God, and the bioimpulses (Pranas) in the cerebrum; 
engaged in yogic practice; meditating on Me and uttering OM â€” the 
sacred monosyllable sound power of Spirit â€” one attains the Supreme 
Abode." (8.12-13) 

Here we provide the details - based on years of research and study of yogic 
scriptures as well as practical experience - for the benefit of sincere seekers. The 
place of meditation should be light-free (a closet), odour-free (no incense), and 
sound-free (no music) for best results. Mornings and evenings (before sun-rise 
and after sunset), as well as half an hour after mid-day and mid-night are the 
best times for meditation. Assume a comfortable posture as given in verse 6.13- 
14, and close your eyes: 

One should sit by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, 
motionless and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily on the front of 
the nose, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless, 



333 



practice celibacy; have the mind under control, think of Me, and have Me 
as the supreme goal. (See also 4.29, 5.27, 8.10, and 8.12) (6.13-14) 

Take few deep inhalation and exhalations. Sincerely ask your guru's/Ishta 
Deva's, or Lord Shiva' s/Ganesha's blessings for success in meditation before 
starting. 

Start: 

Step (1): Inhale slowly and deeply through nose. 

Step (2): Hold the breath for a second only. 

Step (3): Open the lips by making a round opening and chant a strong, 
soft, audible, continuous, humming sound of OM (as 

0...o..o..o...o..M..mm m) with complete sincerity while slowly 

exhaling through the mouth. Let the mind and eyes be focused at an 
imaginary origin of the Omnic sound situated at the pituitary gland inside 
the brain four inches deep from the mid-brows. The mid-brown is also 
known as the Shiva centre, Christ centre, or the sixth Chakra. The place 
near the pituitary gland is called the soul centre, or the seventh Chakra. 



Keep your mind and eyes focussed at the soul Centre, and imagine that the 
shining energy of the Omnic sound wave is flowing from the soul centre to the 
Shiva centre like a river. 

The secret is not in making the sound, but making your mind submerge into the 
fullness of the sound by entering into the core of the sound and trying to become 
one with it. The sound you are using here is not an arbitrary or ordinary sound, 
but a symbol of the Reality the fullness of the universe, and the sound of cosmic 
vibration. 

(You may simplify this technique - by omitting the underlined part - to suit you 
if it becomes difficult to handle to handle in the beginning). 

At the end of exhalation, repeat the process 5 to 11 times starting at step (1). 
After this continue the process, but produce the Omnic vibrations mentally or 
silently for 10 to 15 minutes. The intensity or loudness of the actual or mental 
chanting as well as the speed should be increased if "mind" tends to wander 
faster and vice versa. 



334 



Practice twice a day for one or more months, and then increase the time of 
mental chanting to 25 or more minutes. 

You may also try the mental chanting part using your personal mantra, use any 
one of the mantras: OM, So Hum, Om Namah Shivaaya, or Om Shri Ram Jai 
Ram Jai Jai Ram. 

OM SHANTI
